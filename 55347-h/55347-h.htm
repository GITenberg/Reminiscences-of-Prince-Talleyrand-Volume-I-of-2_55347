</div>

<p>Prince Talleyrand has left a name in Europe
perhaps the greatest ever achieved by any man in
France who has devoted himself exclusively to the
civil offices of the state. In the present century,
he has become as great a diplomatic authority as
was Machiavelli in the sixteenth; and hence the
Hôtel Talleyrand, in the Rue St. Florentin, has
been regarded by every disciple of state-craft who
has visited the French capital, with perhaps as
much veneration as the literary devotee accords
to the more humble abode at Stratford of the
great master of English poetry.</p>

<p>The brilliant career of so public a character as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv">iv</a></span>
Prince Talleyrand has necessarily become much
canvassed, but up to the present time, no account
has been published of his private history, more
particularly of his early life. This, however, could
only be written by some one peculiarly in the
Prince’s confidence, who possessed favourable
opportunities for studying his personal characteristics,
and of becoming acquainted with his
first struggles, experiences, and adventures.</p>

<p>The writer of this work enjoyed such opportunities
in an eminent degree, and was in the
habit of noting down Talleyrand’s revelations and
recollections, which were from time to time imparted
to him; and the result, as now laid before
the public, it will readily be allowed, affords a
more interesting portrait of this illustrious statesman
than has hitherto been given to the world.
Very curious particulars and scenes in Prince
Talleyrand’s own career are combined with extraordinary
anecdotes of his contemporaries, and
details are given of private adventure and domestic
habits, which, in a truly remarkable and novel
manner, illustrate the events of that great drama
in which he acted so conspicuous a part.</p>

</div>

<p>It was during the autumn of 18—, that, passing
through Paris on my way to the south of Europe,
I ventured to pay my <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">visite de rigueur</i> to that hallowed
shrine—that Mecca of all young diplomatists—the
Hôtel Talleyrand, in the Rue St. Florentin,
to obtain, as it were, a blessing and an imposition
of hands from the high-priest of the diplomatic
craft, ere I ventured, novice and without guile as I
then was, to put forth on the unknown sea of
politics. Perhaps there lingered in my mind a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">2</a></span>
latent hope of acquiring some new information
concerning the hidden rocks and shoals, the under-currents,
which were not yet marked down in the
very imperfect chart at that time existing in my
brain, and by the aid of which I might, by steering
aright, gain more quickly than my colleagues the
glorious port of ambassadorship.</p>

<p>I had once had the good fortune to form part of
a company, assembled by the owner of P——
House, to meet the Prince de Talleyrand, during
the very last Easter vacation which he had spent
in England; so that it was not as a complete
stranger that I now ventured, all trembling and
awe-struck, to seek the presence of his excellency.</p>

<p>The hour was somewhat late for a morning visit,
when I called at the hotel; but I had been told by
one who knew him well, that his hour of <em>confidence</em>
and kindness, his hour of <em>benevolence</em>, in short,
was decidedly the one hour before dinner; and so
already, even in the smallest matter, beginning to
move professionally, I had acted entirely upon the
strength of this friendly warning.</p>

<p>I was not disappointed; for I found the veteran
diplomatist enjoying the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">otium cum dignitate</i>,
after the fatigues of the day. He was seated in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">3</a></span>
easy chair, reclining with that peculiarly easy grace
which, in spite of his lameness, characterized his
every attitude and movement. A bundle of newspapers
lay upon the table before him; some were
scattered on the floor around; but he had evidently
forgotten, for the moment, the world and all its
fretful politics, and was gazing with fond affection
at the gambols of his fair young niece, who was on
her knees upon the floor by his side, her arm resting
upon the elbow of his chair, teasing and provoking
the large English spaniel, Carlo, the delight
of the prince, and his constant companion.</p>

<p>It would be difficult for a painter to imagine a
scene more interesting, or even more poetical, than
the one which thus suddenly presented itself to me.
The long golden hair of the child fell forward in
a glittering shower, blending with the silvery
masses which, to the latest hour of his life, shaded
in such luxuriant abundance the calm brow of the
prince; and, as he bent down over her, the contrast
between the fair and blooming face, animated
as it was by the glow of youth and the excitement
of the game, with that cold, impenetrable countenance,
those fixed and marble features, was rendered
yet more striking. It was the dim immovable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span>
Past, seeking to interrogate the busy, smiling
Future; Old Time striving to detain one single rosy
hour, and pausing to gaze while yet the charm
endured. There was, indeed, over the whole scene
a shadow of bygone times, which the graceful
figure of that fair girl alone seemed to attach to
the Present.</p>

<p>The drawing-room into which I was ushered
was noble and lofty, although an <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">entresol</i>, and
through the high casements the setting sun of
autumn poured in its rich and glowing beams,
seeming to pause in fondness over that scene, and,
forgetting all besides, to linger there. Through
the arched vista of the Tuileries, late so green, but
already bared of foliage, the darkening sky gave
token of the near approach of twilight, and I
could not help being struck with the fitness of the
emblem.</p>

<p>I had leisure to contemplate the scene, for the
low suppressed laughter of the child, and the playful
growling of old Carlo, had prevented the announcement
of my name from immediately reaching
the ear of his excellency, and it was not till I
stood within a step or two of his chair that he
became aware of my presence. He then rose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
slightly, leaning on his cane, and gave me that
gracious and courtly welcome—a reminiscence of
the old <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">régime</i>—which neither his passage through
the revolutionary mire, nor even across the broad
Atlantic, had been able to mar. That bland and
polished urbanity was the attribute of a race of
men of which he was the last representative, and of
which we shall see the like no more.</p>

<p>My conference with him was but short, and
passed chiefly in inquiry after the friends I had
left; some few questions concerning my future
destination; an observation or two respecting the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chargé d’affaires</i> at that time resident at the court
to which I was bound; but nothing further; and I,
who had indulged in vague dreams of the treasures
of advice concerning my new career, to be gathered
during this interview, was just on the point of
taking my leave, without having dared to breathe
a hint upon the subject which lay uppermost in
my thoughts, when, to my delight, amid the numberless
kind things he uttered upon the subject of
my journey, he added, with a bland and courteous
smile, which from the old to the young so greatly
enhances the value of the kind speech, “Vous
viendrez nous voir à Valençay?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
And then, as though he had reserved all his
urbanity till the last, acting upon his own principle
of “always waiting to the end,” he told me that he
himself was on the point of hastening thither,—that
I should see him no more in Paris,—that the place
would not be far out of my road on my journey
southwards; and the kindness of the tone, the
friendly glance with which the words were accompanied,
left me no doubt of their sincerity: so I
accepted the invitation with the most joyful alacrity,
and, before we parted, he himself had fixed the day
for our meeting again—at Valençay!</p>

<p>At Valençay! Here, then, was I about to accomplish
by a mighty stride, to overleap by a single
bound, many a weary league on the highway of
politics; and moreover, to gain ease for the remainder
of the dusty journey. So, with these pleasant
illusions in my mind, it cannot be wondered
at if I rather hastened than retarded my movements.
With a heart beating high with expectation did I
set forth on this pilgrimage. It had been one of
my day-dreams, which I was about to convert into
reality. I had so often longed to behold the great
statesman in his retirement, and now I was about
to see him in his hours of leisure and of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">laisser-aller</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>,
and to share with his chosen inmates all the
treasures of his rich and varied store of reminiscences!</p>

<p>I had heard that it was his great delight, when at
Valençay, to call up the spirits of the shadowy
past, and that here he seemed to live and breathe
amongst them; that here he took no heed of to-day,
or of what might befal on the morrow; that
his soul was with the past—his thoughts were all of
days gone by, and lingered not with the present.
By turns abiding amid the courtly saloons of the
days previous to the Revolution, he would tell of
Madame de Boufflers and Marie Antoinette, and of
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">folle vie</i> led by the young, when he, too, was in
his youth. Then the rude Conventional—the stern
Republican—the warlike figures of the Empire—the
pale, dim Silhouettes of the Restoration, would
all arise, and pass in crowded array before his
enchanted audience; with such grace and truth,
too, were they all endowed, that sometimes the listener
could believe that he had seen and heard the
like, and that he too had been of them and among
them.</p>

<p>Valençay had ever been the favourite residence
of the prince. It was here that he had ever preferred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
seeking relief from the political turmoil of
the moment,—perhaps to repose after the fatigues
of the last struggle,—perhaps to gain fresh courage
and vigour for that which, with his unerring foresight,
he knew to be inevitable. It was here that
he sought the rest which he sometimes needed—it
is here that, by his own desire, he now reposes
for ever.</p>

<p>These are the reminiscences which must henceforth
render Valençay one of those few favoured
spots, scattered here and there over the surface of
our dull earth, towards which fancy hurries on
before, and where Memory lingers long behind;
places that shine out, amid the dulness of this
dreary world, with the bright lustre which the
memory of the great and good has shed around
them, and which, to the traveller through the land
where they are found, become hallowed shrines,
that it is scorn and reproach to have visited the
country without beholding.</p>

<p>In my case, and young as I then was, it is no
wonder if I approached, with feelings of almost
undue reverence, the spot where dwelt the last
great statesman of the age—the last, at least, of that
class of men who, singlehanded and alone, could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
lead, by the very force of their spirit, whole nations
to think as they thought, and to act as they directed.
Imagination had indeed gone on long before, and
paused to await me at the gates of the Château of
Valençay. Nor was I disappointed on my first
approach. It is a noble and stately pile, well
suited to the regal tastes and habits of him who at
that time shed additional lustre over its sumptuous
retirement.</p>

<p>The dark forest, through which the road lies for
many miles, gives a grandeur to the scenery, of
which this part of France is elsewhere almost
entirely devoid. The broad Moorish towers of the
château are seen for some time, alternately appearing,
and then lost to sight, until finally they form
the termination of the splendid avenue de Gâtines,
through which they are beheld at a great distance,
gradually rising in the perspective, and seeming to
increase in size as the traveller draws near, with an
effect almost magical. Nothing can be finer or
more original than the appearance of these far-famed
towers, which give to the building an air of
oriental grandeur, perfectly unique. They were
built at different periods, the first one having been
added to the edifice, which at the time was already<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
a mixture of Gothic and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">moyen age</i> architecture,
by M. de Luçay, on his return from his travels in
the East, and their broad shining domes, surmounted
by light gilt weathercocks, bring strangely
to mind the mosques and palaces of the Asiatic
cities.</p>

<p>The approach to the château is particularly grand
and magnificent, being through an avenue of glorious
old chestnut-trees, through which, at the moment
of my arrival, the long rays of the evening
sun were pouring, all aslant, over the green turf,
making wide patches of the soft grass appear all on
flame, while the shadows thrown between appeared
black and mysterious from the contrast. The carriage
drove up the noble avenue de Gâtines. The
gay postillions, with long tricoloured ribbons fluttering
in the wind, with plaited pigtail and heavy
jack-boots, cracking their whips, with loud halloo,
to cheer forward the wild, scampering, rope-harnessed
horses, gave such an <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">air de regence</i> to the
scene, that I could almost fancy myself, as I leaned
eagerly forward in the carriage, to be the hero of
one of Marivaux’s delightful novels, and to be some
one of his dear ingenious Counts de P., about to
pay his first visit to some fascinating, rebellious,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
unfaithful Marquise de F. or de N. Had such indeed
been the case, I do not think the said hero
could have felt more alarmed and embarrassed
than I did during the few moments when the carriage,
having turned into the great gates, drove
with stunning <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fracas</i> round the wide <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cour d’honneur</i>,
and stopped at the princely <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">perron</i> of the
vestibule.</p>

<p>It was quite a relief to learn from the domestic,
who conducted me, through an endless labyrinth of
staircases and corridors, to my room, that the large
party then assembled at the château had all dispersed
after the usual early dinner, and that the
building was at the moment a complete desert.
Nothing could suit me better, for it gave me time to
collect all my scattered ideas, and to establish
myself in the great drawing-room, <em>receiving</em> not
<em>received</em>; and all timid juveniles know well the
full value of this difference. The view from the
windows of this room was magnificent. An ancient
and heavy cloister, forming a cool, shady piazza
during the summer, and a dry and cheerful retreat
in winter, lay immediately without, and through
each arch the varied and rich landscape was
enframed. The broad expanse of park, with its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
dark belt of forest beyond, and the little town of
Valençay, with the Gothic spire of its church, and
the white roofs glittering in the sun, by turns appeared,
as I moved on, like the images in a child’s
magic lantern.</p>

<p>In a short time, the various stragglers began to
return from their walks, and I was delighted when,
among the very first persons who greeted me, I
recognised an old acquaintance, whom I had often
seen in society during the prince’s embassy in
London. Those who have ever felt the delight
of finding an acquaintance in a strange land,
and where we had anticipated meeting none but
strangers, will readily believe my joy at being
greeted in well-remembered accents by C., who
became from that moment a valued and precious
friend, more so than many whom I had known and
loved from childhood, but who were now absent,
and could afford me no aid in encountering the
mighty leviathan within reach of whose tremendous
jaws I seemed so thoughtlessly to have wandered.</p>

<p>With the kind assistance of this friend, however,
I began, in a very short time, to regain my confidence,
and, before the creaking of carriage-wheels
upon the gravel without had announced the return<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
of the Prince from his evening drive, I had been
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mis au courant</i> of all the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">habitudes de la maison</i>,
and the station and character of each individual
had been so fully laid down to me, that I now felt
armed with too much foreknowledge to dread any
longer the ignorance and inexperience which had
so often been my worst enemies.</p>

<p>The room was wellnigh filled by the time the
Prince had descended from his carriage, and, preceded
by old Carlo, barking and yelping, had
slowly traversed the wide vestibule. For such is
the courtierlike propensity of human nature, that,
although no warning-bell had summoned the different
stragglers homeward, yet, by marvellous
instinct, they all seemed aware of the very moment
of the prince’s return to the château, and pressed
eagerly to the saloon to receive him. There was a
general advance towards the door when the prince
entered, leaning on his gold-headed cane, and then
the assembly divided in the midst, to allow him to
pass through, to gain his large fauteuil by the fire.
This movement gave an effect to his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">entrée</i>, of indescribable
interest. Altogether, it was one of the
prettiest pieces of small-court ceremony I ever
witnessed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
The conversation was carried on, for some little
time, standing, the company separating in small
groups; but, when lights were brought, and the
prince had fairly taken his seat at the whist-table,
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i> began, though gradually, to clear. Some
of the guests retired to rest, in order to be abroad
betimes on the morrow; some withdrew stealthily
by a side door, and presently the noise of feet and
the clattering of billiard-balls told plainly the
reason of their absence; anon, another group
would disappear, and then I was sure that a faint
odour of cigars would blow in from the half-closed
window. For me, I bravely resisted every invitation
to move from the seat wherein I had so comfortably
ensconced myself, being sufficiently occupied,
this first evening, in making myself familiar
with all the actors in the scene going on around
me; and I was well repaid for my self-denial, for
at that very moment were assembled, in that old
courtly saloon, some of the brightest intellectual
luminaries of the kingdom.</p>

<p>“You are fortunate,” exclaimed C., as he kindly
came to take his seat beside me, “in being a guest
with some of our most remarkable illustrations
of the ancient <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">régime</i>—men who remain, few in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
number, to tell the generation of our day what
is meant by the ‘wits’ and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">beaux esprits</i> of a
period which, although not distant, yet seems
driven centuries back by the rapidity with which
new eras, new societies, and new dynasties have
succeeded each other. For instance,” continued
he, “there is the Count de M.; I dare not call
him the <em>old</em> count, although, were age measured
by years alone, he would certainly be considered
to have well earned the title. He is already past
the threescore years and ten fixed by the great
Psalmist as the term of man’s life, and yet here he
is, more alive, more pungent, more racy than ever.
I know of no greater contrast than that which
exists between this man and our princely host.</p>

<p>“Look at them as they sit opposite to each other,
both intent upon the chances of the game; the one
so calm and dignified, reflecting almost tediously
upon the card he ought to play; then placing it,
slowly and deliberately, upon the table. Watch
him for ever so long a time, you will detect no
symptom of impatience, no gesture of disappointment,
as the tricks are carried from the board by
his rival. But seldom, even during a run of decided
ill luck, have I seen him bite his pale lip<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
slightly and in silence. Now, look at the count:
see with what bitter merriment he shoves the cards
towards his adversary—how the stinging gibe, the
acid <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bon mots</i> fall from his lips, each sufficient to
ensure success to a whole act of a modern vaudeville—how
he grasps the cards with impatient glee
when they have fallen to his share—his keen eye
lighting up, and his tall, thin figure rising in his
chair, while he pours a burning torrent of witty
pun and quolibet into the ear of his neighbour.
There is more life in that man, in spite of his years,
and the hard life he has led, than in a dozen of
the poor, stunted <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">jeunes Frances</i> who surround
him.</p>

<p>“The prince and M. are like two schoolboys,
hating, dreading each other, yet each one feeling
that the presence of the other is needed to bring
out his own value; they are steel and flint, by
turns giving and receiving blows, and sending up
sparks which dazzle the listener and hold him entranced.
The one, cold and reflective, could crush
his tormentor, were he but allowed time and opportunity;
while the other, by his great presence of
mind, never at fault, and his brilliant and pungent
satire, will sometimes cause his <em>friend</em> to writhe,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
even while he bears the same placid countenance
and the same calm smile.</p>

<p>“An instance of the count’s readiness at repartee,”
continued my friend, “occurred this very
day at dinner. The prosy old dowager-duchess
down yonder, with the lavender satin and the marabout
head-gear, had been descanting most lengthily
upon her genealogy, during the greater part of the
repast. Everybody was yawning most mournfully,
and there were certain symptoms in the brilliant
hawk’s-eye of M., which told to all who knew him
that he was waiting with impatience for a pounce.
The opportunity was not long in presenting itself.
The poor old duchess, by dint of twaddling on undisturbed,
had arrived at the period preceding the
revolutionary war—‘At which time,’ said she,
‘some of our family emigrated to Canada, where a
branch remains to this very day. I have a cousin
there who writes to me sometimes. Her name is
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mousseline</i>—a curious name, is it not, count?”
appealing to M., whose eyes were fixed upon her
with foul intent.</p>

<p>“‘Not at all,’ returned he, quickly, ‘<em>I</em> have a
cousin called <em>Batiste</em>, <em>you</em> have one called <em>Mousseline</em>;—rien
de plus simple!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
“Of course, the whole table was convulsed with
laughter. The one object was gained; the prosy
old duchess was silenced for the rest of the dinner,
and M., elated by his triumph, was more brilliant
and witty than ever. He has made a bitter enemy;
but what cares he so long as the old proser does
not inflict her <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ennuyeux bavardage</i> upon him while
she remains. Of this there is no fear, for I overheard
her servant mention that her carriage must
be ready to depart to-morrow. Life is too short,
according to M.’s declaration, to waste it in listening
to other people’s <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mauvaise prose</i>.’</p>

<p>“The career of the Count M—— has been,
like that of most of the men of note of his own
time, checkered with startling gleams of light, with
fearful intervals of darkness; but his ready wit
and great tact have made him float to this very
hour upon the surface of politics, while many of
his contemporaries, with infinitely more talent, and
certainly more principle, have sunk to rise no
more. The man’s very life has been, for years
past, even to his most intimate friends, a complete
mystery. <em>They</em> only know that he is ruined. He
has been beggared more than once even during the
time that I have known him, but has always risen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
again, more brilliant and more sparkling than
ever. His fire seems, verily, unquenchable, for it
bursts forth from amid the ashes with which poverty
and humiliation would fain seek to smother
it, and burns with a brighter glow after each fruitless
endeavour that his enemies have made to
extinguish it altogether.</p>

<p>“‘<em xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mon pauvre ami!</em>’ said one of his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">roué</i>
friends to him, after one of the many tornadoes to
which, during his life he had been exposed—an
execution in his house, and his horses all sold—‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon
pauvre ami—que te reste-t-il?</i>’</p>

<p>“‘<em xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Moi!</em>’ exclaimed the count, as he turned
away, with light, buoyant step and smiling countenance.
In less than a year he was again <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">remonté</i>,
in full credit and full success; his house, as before,
the resort of all that was gay and brilliant in the
metropolis—himself again the oracle of a wide and
fashionable circle. The answer and the result,
display the character of the man better than whole
pages of written biography could do. His faith
lies in his own capacity for turning to account the
weakness of others, and never has it been deceived.”</p>

<p>“Who is the tall, thin adversary of the count?”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
said I, struck with the appearance of the person,
as he turned and spoke in a low confidential tone
to the prince.</p>

<p>“Oh, that is the Count de F.,” said my friend,
“the antiquated beau of Parisian high life. He
is the same gay philanderer, the same favoured
swain, the object of as many fluttering sighs and
tender regrets, as he was thirty years ago, when he
was in his prime, or forty years ago, when he was
young. Some people have affixed a nearer relationship
between him and the prince than the latter
has ever chosen to avow. Be this as it may, the
count, whether from this cause, or from the number
of years which he has spent in the friendship and
society of the Prince de Talleyrand, has imbibed
much of his ready wit and cold, sarcastic philosophy,
and displays them sometimes at the expense
of others, with the same reckless disregard
of feelings or <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">amour propre</i>. His victims are
numerous, but they too are sometimes fully revenged
by the prince, with whom he cannot vie,
in spite of the florid wit and forked satire in which
he will indulge.</p>

<p>“The poor count had well nigh been overwhelmed,
sunk for ever, on one occasion, by a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
witticism of Talleyrand’s, which spread over Paris
in an incredibly short space, and filled the heart
of the poor old dandy with gall and bitterness.
The prince had always rallied the count most unmercifully
upon his absurd pretensions to youth
and gallantry, and yet, in spite of this, so great is
the infatuating effect of love, that the latter was
foolish and unguarded enough to mention, with
great mystery, a new conquest which he had made,
and upon which he piqued himself not a little.
This time it was a lady of talent, rank, and fashion,
and he wished most particularly to <em>keep</em> his conquest,
now that he had so fairly won it. It was
just at the period of the new year, and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">étrennes</i>
were flying in every direction.</p>

<p>“‘I should like to give the lady of my heart
something that would please her,’ said the count;
‘do assist me, prince; what can I procure that
would be most rare—something unique of its kind—something
that is but seldom seen, and of which the
like could not be brought to her from anybody else.’</p>

<p>“The prince appeared to reflect for a moment,
and the count waited impatiently for the answer.</p>

<p>“‘I have it—I have it,’ at length exclaimed the
prince, joyfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
“‘What? tell me quickly, I will go this moment
and procure it.’</p>

<p>“‘No need to stir,’ returned the prince, drily;
‘give her one of the hairs of your head—if you
can;—it must indeed be a thing unique of its kind,
and of which none could bring her the fellow.’</p>

<p>“This allusion to the baldness of the antiquated
Adonis was irresistible; the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bon mot</i> was sure to
be remembered wherever he appeared, and for a
long time it drove him from the society of those
who had heard it. It was only when he had
<em>proved</em> the reality of his pretensions, by the splendid
marriage which he made soon afterwards,
that he regained confidence, and once more appeared
as you now behold him, more soft and
Cupid-like, more captivating, and more <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">papillonant</i>
than ever.</p>

<p>“The guest, who sits opposite to him, his
partner in the game, is the celebrated Royer Collard,
perhaps, saving our host, the best specimen
of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ancien régime</i> now existing in the country.
As Talleyrand may be taken as type of the old
French nobleman, so may Royer Collard be admitted
as specimen of the ancient French gentleman.
It is a pleasure to look upon that man, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
behold in his calm, open eye, and his broad expanse
of forehead, denoting at once the union of
genius and benevolence, a perfect corroboration of
all the good which one has heard from all parties
concerning him. Throughout every change and
form of government under which he has been
called into action, he has been remarkable for his
inflexible integrity. No swerving—no deviation—no
compromise—but straight-forward has he
marched, without flinching, in the path which he
had chosen. It was he who applied to Guizot the
epithet which it is said so diverted the king.
‘<em xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Austère intrigant!</em>’ exclaimed he, when he heard
that Guizot had again accepted office, after his expressed
determination not to act with the then
existing government. The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mot</i> flew from mouth
to mouth, and, whether correct or not, was at least
<em>successful</em>, which is everything in Paris.</p>

<p>“I firmly believe Royer Collard to be a true and
disinterested friend of the prince. In Paris, they
live much together; scarcely a single day being
suffered to pass without his paying his visit at the
Hôtel Talleyrand. Perhaps he is the only person
amid the crowd by whom the prince is surrounded,
in whom the latter places perfect reliance, because,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
with his keen judgment and great knowledge of
human nature, he knows well enough that he is
the only one with whom interest will yield to
friendship.</p>

<p>“Of course,” proceeded my friend C., “the château
is sometimes visited, like every other château
in the kingdom, by all the ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fâcheux</i>’ and the
‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">importuns</i>’ of the country round, and the prince,
being in a more elevated position than his neighbours,
has also more than their share of hospitality
to bestow. Just observe yonder old gentleman
with the powdered head, looking over M.’s cards,
with a knowing air. That is a near neighbour of
the prince, to whom he is compelled by policy to
do the honours of the house. It is impossible to
behold a better type of the ‘Berrichon,’ whom their
own George Sand has so aptly described as ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">moitié
ours, moitié mouton</i>.’ His estate joins that of
Valençay; part of it can be seen from the windows
of the gallery of the château, and, on looking thence
the other day, he exclaimed to the Count de M.,
who was admiring it, ‘<em xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mon Dieu, comte!</em> just
think: if I had only had the misfortune to lose my
father last year, I might have bought all the land
right away to the left, and made the place worth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
having!’ A whole written volume could not paint
the Berrichon character more clearly than this
single speech. It is verily believed, that were the
thing permitted by law, the Berrichon would throw
his own children into the balance, if it were necessary
to complete a good bargain in the disposal of
his sheep.</p>

<p>“You would be much diverted were you to witness
all the intriguing and manœuvring that is
going forward among the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">propriétaires</i> and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">gentilâtres</i>
of this part of the country, to gain admission
here. This château is looked upon with wonder
and awe, and its broad bastions and Moorish towers
are fabled through the province to contain more
dark secrets and more hidden mysteries than ever
were confided to the grim keeping of the Bastile or
the Seven Towers. A short time ago, the Mayor
of C., a large town of this province, at some little
distance from this, was invited by the prince to
dine at the château, and, as the roads were bad,
and the nights without moon, he was courteously
asked to delay his return home until the following
morning. You may imagine the sudden increase
of importance, the sudden puffing of pride, with
which the worthy mayor accepted the invitation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
and also the parting injunctions of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">madame son
épouse</i>, to bring back to her and her daughters the
long history of all the wondrous deeds which were
going forward inside those aristocratic walls—a
sealed mystery which, from their own experience,
they knew that they could never hope to solve.</p>

<p>“It so happened that, on the very morning of
the day so rife with expectation to the poor mayor,
Comte Molé had arrived at Valençay. Nothing
could be more propitious, and the worthy official
rubbed his hands with glee, at the thought of the
immense information he should gain, by listening
to the conversation of two such distinguished politicians—of
the awful importance of his position
with regard to his colleagues at the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">conseil</i> at home—of
the delight and pride of his ambitious wife,
while she listened to the detail of all her husband
had heard concerning the secret affairs of the
nation; in short, the honest <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bourgeois</i> felt, from the
very moment of his arrival, that tremulous, uncertain
kind of emotion (one hardly knows whether to
call it pain or pleasure), which precedes in most
minds the realization of some dream which has
long been nursed and fostered with great care.</p>

<p>“Dinner passed away; the honest functionary,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
all eyes and ears to what was going forward, listened
intently on every side to catch the least significant
observation which should fall, either from
the lips of his host or of the illustrious guest. But
it was in vain he strained his hearing, listening so
intently that his neighbour was once or twice compelled
to remind him of the dish before him; not
a word of politics was breathed during the whole
repast; and when once, during a short silence
which occurred, he ventured, in a timid voice, to
ask the prince if he thought the Belgian monarchy
would be of long duration, he was merely answered
by a request to take more champagne, and the
conversation once more resumed its light and frivolous
tone. Wit there was in abundance; sparkling
showers, and bold satire, and learning too;
but the ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">maire de son endroit</i>’ cared not for all
the good things which were flying past him from
one end of the table to the other, and convulsing
every listener with bursts of hearty laughter; he
smiled not, poor man, but rather sat lost in painful
wonder, that the great ones of the earth should
thus lose the precious hours in idle bantering and
unseemly mirth! But he hoped that, once in the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i>, the conversation might at length fall into a
more serious and profitable vein, and he had already<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
taken his place close to the prince, determined
to catch each syllable that fell from his
lips when Count Molé approached. This he felt
sure would happen; of course it could not chance
otherwise. At length, Count Molé approached, and
leant over the back of the prince’s chair. He spoke,
in the very ear of the prince, a confidential whisper,
which the mayor heard, however, distinctly, so close
had he drawn to the illustrious friends.</p>

<p>“‘Prince,’ said the count, ‘have you forgotten
old times and all our fierce encounters? Come,
and renew our skill at billiards in the next room;
it will make us both all the younger by twenty
years!’</p>

<p>“Billiards! the Prince de Talleyrand play at
billiards! it could not be; he should have imagined
that his lameness would have saved him from
<em>that</em>. Yet so it was; the Prince de Talleyrand <em>did</em>
play at billiards; and, in spite of his lameness,
was considered one of the most expert players of
his day; and so the poor mayor sat the long evening
through, discomfited and unhappy, with nothing
to tell his wife, and nothing to report to the town
council when next it should meet. The disappointment
was almost too bitter to be borne.</p>

<p>“Hope, however, did not desert him. He well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
knew that the prince and his noble guest could not
play at billiards the whole night, so he sat awhile
waiting with patience, until they should grow tired
of the game, and return to the fireside. And they
<em>did</em> return as he had foreseen, and they <em>did</em> seat
themselves comfortably, one on each side of the
chimney. ‘Now will they discuss their latest protocols,’
thought the little mayor, as he rubbed his
hands in glee. No; the prince was in high spirits,
for he had won at billiards. The count was in
high spirits too, for he declared he had <em>let</em> him win;
and the whole conversation was engrossed by the
discussion—eternal thrust and parry—attack and
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">repartee</i>—which had so worried the mayor at dinner,
and of which he could not at all see the wit—not
he.</p>

<p>“‘At last he was growing quite beside himself,
when the prince arose; which action was the signal
that the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">soirée</i> was concluded, and that the different
guests were free to retire. Yet he had not heard
one single word of politics! What would he have
to say at the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">conseil</i>? What could he tell his
wife? <em>She</em> would greet him with reproaches on
his return home, and would say that such introductions
to the great were of little use, unless he knew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
better how to profit by them; for he felt that, were
he to talk till doomsday, he never should be able
to persuade her that he had heard not one word of
politics. She would accuse him of having napped,
as he always did, and always would do, despite
her admonition.</p>

<p>“Well; the guests all withdrew, our excellent
mayor among the number; but, as he passed the
screen down yonder at the door, upon turning back
to take a wistful glance at the blazing hearth, he
perceived the count reseat himself in the great arm-chair
which he had quitted but for an instant, and
the prince ensconced once more in the one he had
occupied all the evening; he saw the latter draw
forward a little <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">gueridon</i> which stood near, place
upon it a roll of papers which he took from his
pocket, and pointing to them, he heard him say to
the count—‘You see we have <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">besogne</i> enough
before us. I hope you are not sleepy?’</p>

<p>“The curiosity, the ambition, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">amour propre</i>
of the poor mayor were all roused, and, forgetting
the risk he was about to incur—in short, forgetting
all but the opportunity of retrieving lost time—he
slid himself into a chair which stood most invitingly
near the door, in the shadow of the screen, and prepared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
to listen with due attention. There was a
pause, however, during which the prince rose
slightly in his chair, to reach down one of the flambeaux
from the mantel-piece. The mayor stretched
forward eagerly, when his horror may be guessed;
for instead of unrolling the mysterious budget, the
prince turned to the count, and said, ‘Before we
begin upon this business, let us conclude the affair
we were speaking of before dinner. I am sorry
that you have reason to suspect the disaffection of
the municipal council of our town; if so, I think
your are quite right to have it remodelled. Whom
did you say you would like to replace the mayor?’</p>

<p>“The functionary started, and uttered a deep
groan, which no doubt prevented him from hearing
the count’s answer; but the prince again spoke,
and asked his friend what he thought of the present
one. Of course, the answer was most humiliating
for the poor victim, telling of apparent inaptitude
for the office, of his impertinent familiarity, and of
his eager, inconvenient curiosity—until the unfortunate
actually writhed with the pain each word inflicted.</p>

<p>“When the unwelcome harangue was concluded,
the prince arose to take a caraffe of water from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
console. The poor mayor was in an awful fright,
for the action brought the prince immediately opposite
to where he sat, trembling and perspiring from
head to foot. The prince poured the water into a
tumbler and drank it off, and was about retiring to
his seat, when his eye fell upon the figure of the
poor little mayor, who would gladly at that moment
have been a hundred feet below the earth.</p>

<p>“‘Ah! Monsieur L.!’ exclaimed he, ‘why, in
the name of Heaven, have you been thus neglected?
Ring, M. de Molé, here is our worthy friend L. actually
freezing behind the screen, while waiting
for some one to conduct him to his chamber.
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mille pardons</i>, Monsieur L., for this extraordinary
neglect on the part of the servants.’</p>

<p>“The valet-de-chambre appeared.</p>

<p>“‘Conduct Monsieur L., immediately to his
chamber,’ said the prince, significantly, ‘and see
that the like forgetfulness never happens again with
any of the visitors to this house. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bon soir</i>, M. le
Maire, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bonne nuit, et dormez bien</i>!’</p>

<p>“The trembling culprit hurried off without uttering
a word, so great was his confusion, and departed
the next morning at daybreak for his own
home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
“It is needless to say that the story of his removal
from office was a hoax. The prince, in
rising to reach the light from the chimney, had
descried, in the looking glass, the shadow of a
figure on the opposite wall. His quick perceptions
enabled him at once to guess to whom it belonged,
from remembrance of the mayor’s uneasy
curiosity, and indiscreet listening to all that
passed during dinner, and he felt determined to
punish the mean and cowardly listener. A wink
at the count was sufficient; <em>he</em> was not one to
refuse a hint, and together they thus fooled the
victim to their heart’s content. The story got
abroad, and created great laughter throughout
the whole country, and, as might be expected,
the little Mayor of C. was ere long caricatured,
pamphleted, and paragraphed into resigning, and
it was only then that he was allowed to live in
peace, and to forget his fatal visit to Valençay.”</p>

<p>As my friend concluded his story, the whist-table
broke up, and the prince rising, moved towards the
fire, where we were seated, and took the arm-chair
which was always reserved for him. I must confess
that at that identical moment I could enter
into the feelings of the worthy Mayor of C., for I,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
too, longed for the moment when he would expand,
and share with us some of the varied riches of
anecdote with which his mind was stored.</p>

<p>It needed but a single spark to fire the train:
the prince was <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en verve</i> that evening, and I verily
believe a whole volume might be filled with the
bare leaves and cuttings of the “Flowers of Rhetoric,”
with which he charmed us. If he did not
possess, like the antique poet of Dante’s vision, the
power of carrying us into the nether regions, his
charm was greater still; for with a beck he conjured
up the shadows he wished us to behold, and
made them pass in long array before us. One or
two of the anecdotes I will relate, for the benefit of
my readers, but they must not expect to find one
jot of the <em>manner</em> of the narrator—the piquancy,
the <em>verve</em>, the irresistible charm which made the
Prince de Talleyrand avowedly the first story-teller
of his day. If I can give but a faint idea of the
style of conversation which enlivened the long
evenings of autumn beneath the princely domes of
Valençay, it will be as much as I can hope to accomplish,
for the very warmth and vivacity of the
prince’s manner of relating renders it impossible to
repeat his words, and memory fails to retrace the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
fairy chain by which imagination was so sportively
held captive and enthralled.</p>

<p>The conversation had turned upon bonnie Scotland,
and the prince, amid many regrets at his
inability to visit the land where dwelt so many of
his best friends, expressed much curiosity respecting
divers usages and customs of the Scotch, some
of which are so unlike those of any other nation on
the face of the globe. Among other things, he
said he had ever felt an eager desire to witness an
example of second sight, and asked me many
questions concerning this extraordinary gift; to
which I was happily enabled to answer in a satisfactory
manner, from having heard in my own
family of many illustrations of this peculiarity, all
witnessed and backed by the evidence of sundry
old nurses and attendants, who had been for ages
in the family, and of course believed without inquiry.
My poor anecdotes, rough and uncouth as
they were, seemed to interest the company—this
kind of superstition being a thing unknown among
the French, who, if they are gifted with the most
florid wit, have certainly the driest imaginations of
any people in Europe.</p>

<p>“Somnambulism, and the waking sleep, might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
account for the origin of such a wild belief,” said
one of the company.</p>

<p>“Or the faculty of fixing the mind with straining
energy on one point,” said another.</p>

<p>“Or, perhaps the sudden light—the quick, vivid
flash, which reveals to some strong and powerful
minds the <span class="smcap">Possible</span>, the <span class="smcap">True</span>,” said the prince.</p>

<p>“I remember,” continued he, “upon one occasion
having been gifted for one single instant, with
this unknown and nameless power. I know not to
this moment whence it came; it has never once
returned; and yet, upon that one occasion it saved
my life; without that sudden and mysterious inspiration,
I should not now be here to tell the tale.
I had freighted a ship in concert with my friend
Beaumetz. He was a good fellow, Beaumetz, with
whom I had ever lived on the most intimate terms;
and, in those stormy times, when it needed not
only friendship to bind men together, but almost
godlike courage to dare to show that friendship, I
could not but prize most highly all his bold and
loyal demonstrations of kindness and attachment
to me. I had not a single reason to doubt his
friendship; on the contrary, he had given me on
several occasions most positive proofs of his sincere<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
devotion to my interests and well-being. We had
fled from France together, we had arrived at New
York together, and together we had lived in perfect
harmony during our stay there. So, after
having resolved upon improving the little money
that was left us by speculation, it was still in
partnership and together that we freighted a small
vessel for India, trusting all to the goodly chance
which had befriended us in our escape from danger
and from death, to venture once more <em>together</em> to
brave the storms and perils of a yet longer and
more adventurous voyage.</p>

<p>“Everything was embarked for our departure;
bills were all paid and farewells all taken, and we
were waiting for a fair wind with most eager expectation—being
prepared to embark at any hour
of the day or night, in obedience to the warning of
the captain. This state of uncertainty seemed to
irritate the temper of poor Beaumetz to an extraordinary
degree, and, unable to remain quietly at
home, he hurried to and from the city, with an
eager, restless activity which at times excited my
astonishment, for he had ever been remarkable for
great calmness and placidity of temper.</p>

<p>“One day, he entered our lodging, evidently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
labouring under great excitement, although commanding
himself to appear calm. I was engaged
at the moment, writing letters to Europe, and, looking
over my shoulder, he said with forced gaiety,
‘What need to waste time in penning those letters?
they will never reach their destination. Come with
me, and let us take a turn on the Battery; perhaps
the wind may be chopping round; we may be
nearer our departure than we imagine.’</p>

<p>“The day was very fine, although the wind was
blowing hard, and I suffered myself to be persuaded.
Beaumetz, I remembered afterwards, displayed an
unusual officiousness in aiding me to close my desk
and put away my papers, handing me, with hurried
eagerness, my hat and cane, and doing other little
services to quicken my departure, which at the
time I attributed to the restless desire for change,
the love of activity, with which he seemed to have
been devoured during the whole period of our
delay.</p>

<p>“We walked through the crowded streets, to the
Battery. He had seized my arm, and hurried me
along, seemingly in eager haste to advance. When
we had arrived on the broad esplanade, the glory
then, as now, of the city of New York, Beaumetz<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
quickened his step yet more, until we arrived close
to the water’s edge. He talked loud and quickly,
admiring in energetic terms the beauty of the
scenery, the Brooklyn Heights, the shady groves
of the island, the ships riding at anchor, and the
busy scene on the peopled wharf; when suddenly
he paused in his mad, incoherent discourse, for I
had freed my arm from his grasp, and stood immovable
before him. Staying his wild and rapid
steps, I fixed my eyes upon his face. <em>He turned
aside, cowed and dismayed.</em> ‘Beaumetz,’ I shouted,
‘<em>you mean to murder me</em>—you intend to throw me
from the height into the sea below. Deny it,
monster, if you can!’</p>

<p>“The maniac stared at me for a moment, but I
took especial care not to avert my gaze from his
countenance, and he quailed beneath it. He stammered
a few incoherent words, and strove to pass
me, but I barred his passage with extended arms.
He looked vacantly right and left, and then flung
himself upon my neck and burst into tears. ‘’Tis
true—’tis true, my friend. The thought has haunted
me day and night, like a flash from the lurid fire
of hell. It was for this I brought you here. Look,
you stand within a foot of the edge of the parapet—in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
another instant, the work would have been
done!’</p>

<p>“The demon had left him; his eye was still unsettled,
and the white foam stood in bubbles on his
parched lips; but he was no longer tossed by the
same mad excitement under which he had been
labouring so long, for he suffered me to lead him
home without a single word. A few days’ repose
and silence, bleeding and abstinence, completely
restored him to his former self, and, what is most
extraordinary, the circumstance was never mentioned
between us. My <span class="smcap smaller">FATE</span> was at work. It was
during those few days of watching by the bedside
of poor Beaumetz, that I received the letters from
France which announced to me the revocation of
the decree which had sent me a wanderer to
America. The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Directoire</i> had relented, and I was
invited to return with all speed. I sought not to
resist the appeal, and at once decided on leaving
Beaumetz to prosecute our speculation alone, and
on returning to Paris immediately.</p>

<p>“The blow was cruel to poor Beaumetz, who
was fully persuaded, I have no doubt, that it was
in dread of another attack on his part that I had
now the wish to leave him. No argument I could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
make use of, no assurances of unchanged friendship,
could shake his opinion, and our parting was
a most stormy and painful one. I made over to
him my interest in the ship which we had freighted
together, and he departed for India, while I bent
my course once more towards my <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">belle France</i>.</p>

<p>“Once more in a position to assist my friends,
my first thought was of Beaumetz, and one of my
first acts was the cancelling of his death-warrant.
I wrote to him to announce the joyful news, addressing
my letter to the merchant at Calcutta to
whom he had been recommended. In due time,
receiving no answer, I wrote again; but my letters
were returned, with the information that the ship,
which had sailed from New York some months
before, and of which M. Beaumetz was supercargo,
had not arrived, that no tidings had been received
of its fate, and that great fears were entertained of
its total loss. The apprehension was justified, <em>for
from that day to this no tidings have ever been
received of the ship, nor, alas! of my poor friend
Beaumetz!</em>”</p>

<p>The prince paused a moment, seeming to collect
his sad remembrances of Beaumetz, and I could
not but admire the singular good fortune which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
had caused him to abandon his voyage to India.
How different might have been the fate of France,
nay, of Europe, had he sailed in that ship! Well
may he have gained among his friends the title of
“Fortune’s master!”</p>

<p>“But what was really the motive of your first
suspicion of the murderous intent of Beaumetz?”
said one of the company.</p>

<p>“I know not to this very hour,” replied the
Prince de Talleyrand; “it was not his eye, for I
was not looking at him at the moment, I was gazing
at the sublime view which he himself was pointing
out to my notice;—it was not in the tone of his
voice either, in which lay the warning of my
danger; it was a sudden and mysterious impulse
for which I have never been able to account—one
of those startling and fearful mysteries which even
the strongest minds are contented to accept without
inquiry, being satisfied that such things are,
and never daring to ask wherefore. Many persons,
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Illuminés</i> for example, who ruled the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">monde
philosophique</i> for so long a period, have ascribed
this sudden revelation of the hidden <span class="smcap smaller">TRUTH</span> entirely
to the effects of magnetism, and there are
instances well known, wherein the great masters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
of the art have been able to produce the same
effect at pleasure. Cagliostro, to whom I once
mentioned the circumstance, had often obtained
the same results by his wonderful powers of magnetism.”</p>

<p>“What, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon prince</i>, have you ever seen Cagliostro?”
exclaimed the fair Duchess de V., raising
her head from her tapestry frame, and gazing into
the prince’s face, with an amusing expression of
wonder and of awe.</p>

<p>“Ay, that have I,” returned the prince, gravely;
“often have I seen him, fair lady, and am not of
those who condemn him at once, without examination,
unthinkingly, as an impostor; for the man
<em>believed</em> himself: no wonder, then, that he could
so easily persuade others.”</p>

<p>“Oh, now, do tell us something about this Cagliostro!”
exclaimed the young duchess, shaking
back her fair ringlets, as she leant eagerly forward,
and laid her white and jewelled hand upon the
elbow of the prince’s chair; “do tell us all about
your interview with the famous magician; but
mind, tell us the truth. Where did he live?—how
did he look?—what did he wear?”</p>

<p>“Nay,” returned the prince, smiling, “were I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
to tell all I know concerning him, my story would
not be done till to-morrow night, at this same
hour.”</p>

<p>We all involuntarily followed the direction of
his gaze towards the clock upon the mantelpiece.
Alas! the hand was wearing round, and stood
within a very few minutes of the hour of one.</p>

<p>“We must defer the story of Cagliostro’s wonders
till another time,” said he, “but you shall not
lose by waiting. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vous n’y perdrez rien, madame.</i>
But you shall sleep <em>this</em> night at least in peace;
which you might never do again should you
happen to <em>believe</em>! So, messieurs, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bonne nuit—à
demain</i>.”</p>

<p>He arose. Of course the whole assembly followed
the movement, and in a few moments each
one had retired.</p>

<p>My chamber was in one of the turrets which
form the corner towers of the château, and, by a
most singular piece of good fortune, I found that
it was close to that of my friend. We lingered
some few minutes, taper in hand, upon the threshold,
and, with his usual kindness, C. proposed to
me, as he took his leave for the night, to conduct
me through the château and grounds on the
morrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
“We are all independent here,” said he; “you
must not feel surprised if you are left to cater for
your own amusement until dinner, for each one
does what is right in his own eyes, and the morrow’s
plans are determined on before night; so
that interlopers must necessarily be excluded, for
the first day at least. But you shall not be quite
abandoned; I will be with you betimes in the
morning, and we shall have ample occupation for
a long day, in wandering over the beauties of this
place, which must some day become one of the
most celebrated spots in our country.”</p>

<p>He left me, and I soon sank to sleep, dreaming
of all I had seen and heard, and with anticipations,
too, of what more I was to see and hear before I
took my departure from Valençay.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_II" class="vspace">CHAPTER II.<br />

<span class="subhead">CONDUCT OF TALLEYRAND AT THE REVOLUTION OF 1830.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It will be readily believed that I needed no
arousing on the morrow. In spite of my weary
journey, and the late hour of retiring to rest, I
was up and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sur pied</i> long before my friend had
left his chamber. The morning was beautiful, and
from my window it was pleasant to watch the departure
of the hounds and sportsmen from the
court-yard to the green forest. For my part, however,
I felt no envy, but rather stood wondering
that people endowed with the sense of hearing
could endure with patience the eternal twang of
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cor de chasse</i>, of all sounds, I verily believe,
the most fatiguing and abominable.</p>

<p>I went down to await C. upon the green <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pelouse</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
which lay so invitingly before my window, and I
paused to look up with interest at the broad
frontage of the château, which lay in the light of
the morning sun, whose beams, reflected on the
shining domes of the huge Moorish towers, made the
whole building bring to mind some rich and sumptuous
palace of the Levant. It was the delight of
the prince to say that “many were the seigneurs
of the country who could put forth the old feudal
boast of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pignon sur rue</i>, and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">donjon sur roche</i>,
but that it was reserved for him to display the
broad flanking towers of the Turkish seraï or
Moorish generalife. It was not long before I was
aroused from my gaze of admiration by my friend,
who came bounding over the grass to meet me.
He smiled as he beheld the reverential look I fixed
upon the window which he had pointed out as
belonging to the chamber of the prince, where the
drawn curtains and closed <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">jalousies</i> announced the
profound repose in which its inmate was still buried.</p>

<p>“You are like the rest of the world,” said he,
taking my arm. “I know that at this moment you
are nursing all kinds of fancies, the one more
absurd and ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">banal</i>’ than the other, concerning the
old diplomate’s sleeping visions, which already I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
have seen compared in one of your newspapers to
the ‘slumbers of the rattlesnake, or the solitary
dreamings of the hyæna waiting for his prey, and
sure that it cannot escape his cruel jaws.’ Nothing,”
continued he, “can be more unjust than
the opinions, formed in England of the extreme
cunning of the character of Prince Talleyrand,
of the far sight of his self-interest, of his habitual
deception. They add another example to the
many on record of most extraordinary popular
delusions. No man was ever perhaps more influenced
by the circumstances of the moment, and
less resolved upon the course he would pursue
until the time arrived for action, than the prince.
The conduct which he pursued during the events
of the revolution of July has fully proved this,
and, when you and I have time and privacy, I
think I could win you over to my opinion.”</p>

<p>“And why not at this moment?” said I. “The
occasion is among the best. We are alone, and
scarcely likely to be interrupted; and, while we
wander across the park, I can listen with as much
attention as though we were closeted together in
the most silent chamber of the château.”</p>

<p>C. took my arm and moved forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
“I can but give you my own impressions concerning
the opinions of Prince Talleyrand during
the eventful struggle of the three days,” said he;
“but you may rely upon the truth of my statement
of the <em>facts</em> which took place upon that occasion.
I was present with him during the whole time, an
eye-witness to the various emotions by which he
was governed, and could judge, as far as my own
powers of observation went, of the divers motives
by which he was actuated.”</p>

<p>As such, I give my friend’s opinions to the
reader, begging him to remember that they are
those of one who knew Prince Talleyrand well,
who had been admitted to his intimacy for many
years before his death, and that they may be of
value, as furnishing the interpretation of many
things hitherto problematical.</p>

<p>“Many people,” continued my friend, “have
been led by the political writers of the day into
error, concerning the real causes of the revolution
of July; they are eager to represent the courage
and patriotism displayed by the liberal party on
that occasion of sudden and spontaneous explosion
of popular fury, as the effect of a deeply-laid plot,
conceived for many months before; and they seek<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
to impress the public with a false idea of the
diplomacy of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chefs de parti</i> in the triumphs of
the three days. Another idea which has become
as general is, that the statesman who had played
so conspicuous a part in all our revolutions, from
that of 1789 to that of 1830, and had lent with
such good grace to each successive government
the aid of his splendid talents—whose word, indeed,
seemed to decide upon their very existence—was
no stranger to the struggles and intrigues
which ended in the downfal of Charles X., and the
banishment of his dynasty from the soil of France.
Without pretending here either to condemn or
justify the conduct pursued by Prince Talleyrand
under other governments, and which history, freed
by time from party spirit and from political passion,
will alone be able to judge with equity, let us examine
coolly the part he took in the revolution of
July. <em>Facts</em> may serve better than <em>opinions</em>, to
enable the observer to judge with more correctness
the character of this great man, so little known in
reality, even at the present time.</p>

<p>“It cannot be denied that, at the period to
which I now refer (1830), the opinions of M. de
Talleyrand were most unfavourable to the government<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
of Charles X. Like every other man of sense
and foresight throughout the kingdom, he beheld
with dread the dissolution of the Martignac ministry,
and the substitution of the Polignac administration;
but such political inconsistencies could
not astonish, coming from a man of the stamp of
Charles X., whose whole life had been a tissue of
inconsistencies, from the famous protest of the
Count d’Artois, upon the occasion of the States-General
in 1789, to the fatal appointment of the
ministry which was to send him forth a second
time to emigration, from which he had returned
once before, according to Prince Talleyrand’s own
expression long previous to the catastrophe, ‘<em>having
learnt little and forgotten nothing</em>.’ M. de Talleyrand,
nevertheless, did ample justice to the many
good qualities which distinguished the king in
private life, and the more he overwhelmed him
with contempt as a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chef de parti</i>, the more he was
pleased to acknowledge in him a feeling and generous
nature, and a faithful and grateful friend. In
point of real and sterling worth he placed him far
above his brother Louis XVIII., whom he accused
of ‘having no friends—only favourites,’ and who
in his whole life never had the heart to grant a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
pardon to a single criminal. The one was a better
king, the other a far better man.</p>

<p>“Charles X., however, returned tenfold in hatred
and suspicion all the pity and contempt which the
wily diplomate sought to cast upon his government;
and moreover, the devout monarch never could
forget that the Bishop of Autun had renounced the
Church, and had married, in spite of the threatened
excommunication and eternal damnation voted
by Rome as the punishment of such a step; for,
although Pope Pius VII. had absolved the bishop
from his vows of priesthood, it was never without a
thrill of horror that the king beheld on court days
his grand chamberlain, who seldom failed on occasions
of ceremony and etiquette to present himself
before his royal master, in spite of the cold reception
he met with in the court circles, where his
tottering gait and sarcastic speech had earned for
him the sobriquet of ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Le Diable Boiteux</i>.’ The
king, blinded by prejudice, even forgot, in this instance,
the papal authority; for the marriage of the
prince had been sanctioned by the Pope, and was
therefore legal in the eyes of the most pious
Catholics.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, at the epoch of the Martignac<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
administration, it seemed as if a kind of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rapprochement</i>
had taken place, if not between M. de Talleyrand
and the king, at least between the former
and the ministry. The men who composed this
ministry<a id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> all of them possessed a degree of moderation
in their political opinions, which M. de Talleyrand
could not but admire, and, wishing to
prove that until then he had been opposed, not to
the king’s government, but to the principles of the
ministry who had conducted it, he sought by every
means to show publicly his sympathy for the new
ministers. He was seen once more to frequent the
ministerial salons, and received the ministers at
his own hotel with that <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">haute politesse</i> and courtly
urbanity for which he was so distinguished, expressing
upon every occasion the satisfaction which
he felt at seeing the helm of public affairs at last in
the grasp of men whose experience rendered them
able to comprehend the exigencies of the country,
and possessed of resources enabling them to provide
the most efficient means of meeting them. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
satisfaction was but of short duration. In the month
of August following, Charles X., yielding to the instigations
of his secret counsellors, who worked
upon his unenlightened conscience—taking, himself,
undue alarm at the first check sustained by
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ministère</i> Martignac in the Chamber of Deputies—replaced
the members of his cabinet by the
Polignac administration. Throughout the kingdom
there arose a cry of indignation at this step.</p>

<p>“M. de Talleyrand, grieved to see the false line
of conduct into which the king was falling, but
incapacitated from affording help, and moreover,
assailed each day by some new vexation, took advantage
of a short illness to withdraw for a while from
court, in order to restore his health at the château
of his niece, the Duchess de Dino, at Rochecotte,
in Touraine, where he resolved to pass the ensuing
winter.</p>

<p>“Various have been the motives attributed to
this retirement at Rochecotte. I am aware that many
of the public papers have asserted, and other
writers of graver stamp have repeated, that it was
during this winter that the plan of attack against
Charles X. was conceived and matured, between
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chefs</i> of the liberal party and M. de Talleyrand,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
who, according to general belief, had engaged
himself to lend them the aid of his counsel and
high influence.</p>

<p>“What gave some little colouring to these reports
was the fact, that M. de Talleyrand reckoned
among his most intimate friends some of the most
violent members of the opposition, who, at the
moment of the revolution of 1830, by the force of
circumstances, found themselves at the head of
the new code of things which they had so long
and so ardently desired, and which, after all, was
established without their direct influence, as will
be proved by a bare recital of facts. Thus, M. de
Talleyrand received into his daily intimacy General
Sébastiani, the Duc de Broglie, M. Villemain,
M. Bertin de Vaux, and M. Molé; all of whom,
however, remained passive spectators of the
struggle, until the moment when the chance turned
in favour of the popular party. There was one
man, however, who took an active part in the revolutionary
movement, who had prepared and ordered
its march by his attacks in the journal of which he
was principal editor, and whom M. de Talleyrand
encouraged and distinguished by most particular
favour. It was, indeed, at Rochecotte, during the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
month of May, which Thiers spent there with M.
de Talleyrand, that he conceived the plan of those
terrific articles in the <cite>National</cite>, which every morning,
like the battering ram of ancient warfare, laid
in ruins the wretched bulwarks behind which the
tottering monarchy thought itself secure.</p>

<p>“Thiers, in fact, did conspire against the government
of Charles X.; but it was conspiracy
not with this leader or with that; not with such
and such a party; but with the immense majority of
the nation, to whom he spoke the language they
had seldom heard, and which they all could understand;
the language of their old affections and of
their craving need. But thence to argue that M.
Thiers came to Rochecotte to concert with M. de
Talleyrand the plan of the <cite>National</cite>, and the overthrow
of the government, would be to make M. de
Talleyrand play a part much beneath him. It
must also be remembered that Thiers was at that
time a sub-editor of the <cite>Constitutionnel</cite>, and that
nothing foretold in him the future President of
Louis Philippe’s council. His History of the Revolution,
full as it was of false ideas and monstrous
principles, thanks to some few narratives of
interest, and to the great name of Napoleon, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
is retraced in grand and noble characters, had
established for its author a certain reputation in
the literary world. But of a surety, M. de Talleyrand,
notwithstanding the high opinion he entertained
of the talents of Thiers as a man of business,
would have been much astonished if, at that
period, in his salon at Rochecotte, some modern
Cassandra had predicted that the author of the
“Revolution Française” would one day become
Prime Minister and Chief of the French Cabinet!
M. de Talleyrand, with all his boasted perspicacity,
his foresight, and his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">justesse d’esprit</i>, would
have considered it as a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mauvaise plaisanterie</i> that
a man <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sans position sociale</i>, an <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">homme de rien</i>,
should ever be considered eligible as a leader of
public affairs in a country like France.</p>

<p>“M. Thiers was, in the eyes of M. de Talleyrand,
nothing more than a young writer, full of
vigour and talent, whom the old seigneur loved to
protect, and to initiate into the manners and
customs of good society, without a knowledge of
which (he would often say) there can be no good
taste in literature. But he was the last person in
the world who, at that time, could have looked
upon Thiers as a conspirator, of whom he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
making himself, by such protection, the vile associate.</p>

<p>“The men of July, whether to curry favour
with the new dynasty, or to assume the part of
profound politicians, have pretended that they had
prepared the fall of Charles X., and they boast
that their machinations had aroused the tempest
which, in three short days, swallowed up a whole
generation of kings. These men have either sought
to deceive public opinion, or else have been themselves
grossly deceived. Nothing was ever more
unlike a conspiracy than the Revolution of 1830;
or if conspiracy <em>did</em> exist, it was public, general,
and unanimous; one in which the whole country
bore a part, saving only that small portion of the
community bound by ties of honour and gratitude
to the elder branch of the House of Bourbon. In
fact, there was not a single human being endowed
with sense, from one end of France to the other,
who, even long before the issuing of the fatal
‘Ordonnances’ of July, could not have foretold
whither the multifarious blunders of Charles X.’s
government were hurling the monarchy; but not a
soul had the slightest presentiment that the day of
reckoning was so nigh; and, as proof of this, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
may be remembered that those men of talent most
opposed to the Restoration, such as MM. Pasquier,
Molé, Royer Collard, Sébastiani, De Barante,
Guizot, De Broglie, and many others, were
struck as by a thunderbolt at the first news of
those accursed ‘Ordonnances.’</p>

<p>“Among these men stood first and foremost
M. de Talleyrand, who could scarcely credit the
<cite>Moniteur Officiel</cite> which contained them. To
assert then that M. de Talleyrand <em>conspired</em>
against the Bourbons—that by his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">liaisons</i> with
the opposition, and above all, with the Duke of
Orleans, he brought on the fall of the elder branch,
and the rise of the younger (which it may be
allowed he had long foretold)—proves a total
ignorance of the circumstances in which M. de
Talleyrand was placed, and adds one more to the
numerous calumnies which it has been the pleasure
of so many writers to heap upon the head of
this celebrated statesman. But, if the prince did
not absolutely rush to meet the events of July,
it cannot be denied that, with his accustomed tact,
he knew how to profit by the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">faits accomplis</i>, and
that, being once certain of the flight of Charles X.,
he pointed out, with the rare sagacity with which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
he was gifted, and which age had rather increased
than diminished, to his old friend the Duke of
Orleans, the line of conduct to be pursued in
order to avoid, amid the stormy tides by which he
was beset, seeking to steer his course against the
will of the people.</p>

<p>“It has been to this day a matter of speculation
whether the Duke of Orleans had anticipated being
called to the throne, or whether it was the force of
circumstances which had brought him to it. These
are the facts:—although the Duke of Orleans had
for a long time looked upon the event of a change
in the dynasty as <em>possible</em>, and was most certainly
<em>prepared</em> to place the crown upon his own head
in case of such an event, yet even so late as the
30th of July, he hesitated to grasp it, and resisted
the arguments and persuasions of Thiers. It is a
known fact that the duke was concealed in the environs
of Neuilly, in fear of a popular outbreak,
when a secret message from M. de Talleyrand,
which he received on the evening of that day,
caused him to decide at length upon re-entering
Paris, and proclaiming himself Lieutenant-General
of the Kingdom—the Head of the new Power.
The new king soon forgot, however, this proof of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
attachment on the part of his old friend; and M.
de Talleyrand, who knew that kings, even when
chosen by the will of the people, are, for the most
part, compelled to be <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">illustres ingrats</i>, never,
during the years which followed these events,
alluded to the circumstances which brought about
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">avénement</i> of Louis Philippe.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as it is entirely to this secret influence
of Prince Talleyrand, which swayed the
decision of the Duke of Orleans, that France is
indebted for the new dynasty, it may be interesting
to the reader to give, from the authority of one who
was with the prince during the memorable days,
and the truth of whose statements may be relied on,
some account of what took place on that occasion.</p>

<p>“M. de Talleyrand,” continued C., “was, at the
time, in his hotel in the Rue St. Florentin, and, on
the first day, before any one could foretel the issue
of the terrible drama which had just begun, far
from displaying any degree of sympathy for the
resistance which was beginning to be organized in
every quarter of Paris, he looked on with a feeling
of terror at the unchaining of the populace; for
he had often said, that “neither experience nor
prophecy could ever calculate the chances of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
dawning revolution. Would the people, when
once let loose in the revolutionary arena, renew
the bloody scenes of ’93, or would they pause
before the memory of that dread, terrific epoch?
Could any one, at that hour, have dared to hope that
Paris would have given to the world the sole example
in history of a roused and angry multitude,
staying its tide of fury even in the midst of intoxicating
triumph?</p>

<p>“M. de Talleyrand <em>did not</em> foresee this possibility.
The souvenirs of youth came back upon
his age, and showed him the people conquering,
using and abusing the right that conquest gives;
pillaging the hotels of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">noblesse</i>, and, in bloody
triumph, sparing no superiority, either of station,
rank, or fortune; and, it might be also, if the truth
were known, trembling himself to be the first victim
of popular rage; for he knew that the people loved
him not: he had been the instrument of the restoration
of the Bourbons. Such were the thoughts
which occupied the mind of M. de Talleyrand
during the first of these days, and, with those who
can bear witness to the uneasiness which he betrayed
during those hours of doubt and terror, he
is perfectly exonerated from the suspicion of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
having <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">prepared</i> the change which was taking
place before his eyes.</p>

<p>“On the second day, the 28th, when the people
were combating against the king’s troops for the
possession of the Hôtel de Ville, while the air was
filled with the old and dreaded sounds, the cannon’s
roar, the tocsin’s boom, his confidence in the
success of the king’s power of defence forsook him
at once, and he then pronounced the memorable
sentence which has since become familiar to the
readers of French literature: ‘The cannon which
is fired against the people cannot but shake the
sovereign’s throne.’ At the moment when the
tocsin announced the triumph of the people at the
Hôtel de Ville, he looked at the clock upon the
mantelpiece. It was then just upon the stroke of
five. ‘A few minutes more,’ exclaimed he, ‘and
Charles X. is no longer King of France.’</p>

<p>“One good instance of his presence of mind
occurred at this very moment, for he turned to his
valet-de-chambre, and made him immediately
collect together the men-servants of the hotel, and
take down the words ‘<span class="smcap">Hotel Talleyrand</span>,’ which
flaunted in large golden characters over the gateway,
the feudal pride of other times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
“I still maintain the perfect conviction that,
even up to the very hour of which I speak, he was
undecided as to the course he would adopt; he was
evidently waiting for the issue of the struggle.
Public rumour has lent him a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bon mot</i>, which is
certainly in his style, although I was with him the
whole day, and did not hear him pronounce it.</p>

<p>“‘Hark! the tocsin ceases—we triumph!’</p>

<p>“‘<em>We!</em> who, mon prince?’</p>

<p>“‘Chut, not a word! I will tell you that to-morrow.’</p>

<p>“If his secret wishes were really in favour of a
new order of things, with his habitual prudence, he
made it a duty to conceal them; and he spent the
whole of the second day fixed at the windows of
the drawing-room of the hotel, which looks into
the Place Louis Quinze, sending every now and
then his emissaries into the divers quarters of Paris,
to bring back accounts of the progress of the revolution.
MM. de Broglie, Bertin de Vaux, and
Sébastiani were with him, and all, excepting the
prince, were of opinion that the king would attempt,
before the morning, to re-enter Paris at the head of
his troops. <em>He</em> knew the character of the man too
well either to hope or to fear this decision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span>
“On the 29th, however, when M. de Talleyrand
began to be convinced that the cause of the revolution
was triumphant, that the liberal deputies, Casimir
Périer, Laffitte, Lafayette, all, not only pronounced
themselves in its favour, but sought to
direct the insurrection, and to place themselves at
its head, he felt at once the immense advantage
that such a demonstration would give to the
Chamber of Deputies over the Chamber of Peers;
and his only thought during the whole day was to
collect together at his own house the few men of
intelligence among the peers of the opposition, in
order to balance, in the public opinion, by some
patriotic declaration, the influence already gained
by the deputies, from the position in which they
had placed themselves—that of ‘Defenders of the
Charter.’ But all the efforts of the prince were
unavailing. The great number of his friends, such
as Pasquier and Molé, hesitating to declare their
opinions thus openly, in dread of the return of
Charles X., declined taking a part in the protest of
the deputies. M. de Talleyrand was pained to the
quick by this want of decision, and foretold, with
an accuracy which has since become manifest, all
the bad consequences which would fall upon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
Chamber of Peers, from having remained passive
during this eventful crisis.</p>

<p>“By early dawn on the 30th, the people were,
however, masters of Paris—of all the military posts—of
all the barricades of the Tuileries—of the
Louvre, and of the hotels of the ministers. The
royalist troops had withdrawn, and were encamped
round St. Cloud, where still lingered, in faint hope,
in inert expectation, Charles X. and his court.</p>

<p>“Suddenly a report arose, and spread like wild-fire
through Paris! The old king, alarmed at the
consequences of a civil war, had decided on immediate
flight! M. de Talleyrand, at first, would give
no credence to the rumours. He could not believe
it possible that the king, being still surrounded by
12,000 devoted troops, would so soon abandon the
chances of the game, and, before he declared himself,
he sent to St. Cloud to ascertain the truth of the statement.
The return of the messenger staggered us all.
He brought word that Charles had fled from St. Cloud,
and was proceeding with all expedition to Rambouillet.
At that moment, M. de Talleyrand’s
doubts were at an end; he decided at once upon
the course he would pursue; and, in this circumstance,
as in so many others wherein he has been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
accused of changing his politics to suit the hour,
he might have answered as he had once done
before, ‘It is not I who desert the king—it is the
king who deserts us.’</p>

<p>“Now came the time when the high intelligence
and marvellous sagacity of the prince were brought
into action, and, I hesitate not to repeat, saved the
country. M. de Talleyrand dispatched to Neuilly,
with all possible speed, a little billet written with
his own hand. The bearer was a person of high
courage and great integrity, and was charged,
should he fall into danger, or be arrested at the
barrier, to destroy the billet. He could not in
honour read its contents, but saw that there were
but few words traced upon the paper. They were
addressed to the king’s sister, Madame Adelaide.
This messenger was commissioned to place the
billet himself in the hands of the princess, and to
tell her that the Prince de Talleyrand conjured her
to warn the Duke of Orleans that not a moment
was to be lost—that the Duke might reckon upon
his aid, and that he must appear immediately—that
he must come at once to Paris, to place himself at the
head of the movement, or all would be lost without
recall. Above all, he was only to take the title of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Lieutenant-General of the Kingdom, which Charles
had conferred upon him before leaving St. Cloud:—he
implored him not to manifest any other intention.
In this advice the old diplomatist was reserving
for himself a back door to creep out at in case
Charles should march on Paris.</p>

<p>“Madame Adelaide received the message with
ill-dissembled joy. With woman’s <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">astuce</i>, however,
she declined giving an answer in writing, as
there were no writing implements in the room, and
she dared not ask the servants for them; being
aware that the whole house was filled with spies,
she knew not whom to trust at such a moment.
She even took the precaution of returning the
paper received from the prince, fearing either to
retain or destroy it, lest its traces might be discovered.
The messenger then took back this verbal
message: ‘That her brother would be most grateful
for the assistance which Prince Talleyrand thus
offered—that he was for the moment <em>absent from
Neuilly</em>—but that she would immediately have the
prince’s message conveyed to him, and would herself
use her most earnest endeavour to persuade
him to go at once to Paris.’ The Duke of Orleans
was, before night, established in the Palais Royal,
and, in a few hours after his arrival, the walls of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
capital were covered with placards and proclamations,
signed <span class="smcap">Louis Philippe, Lieutenant-General
of the Kingdom</span>.</p>

<p>“Still, there remained an immense distance to
overleap before the crown could be grasped by
the lieutenant-general. On the one hand, the republican
party were howling with rage, to find the
republic vanishing still further from their embrace—that
dear-beloved republic, for whose sake they
had rushed so blindly on the chances of a revolution.
On the other side, the great mass of the
citizens remained calm, and indifferent to the rise
of another Bourbon. As to the party calling itself
Carlist at the present day, it must have been very
small indeed, for, in the hour of danger, it was invisible!
The Orleans party, meanwhile, comprised
all the leading members of the Opposition in both
Chambers. At the head of this party was M. de
Talleyrand, who, without exactly declaring himself
in favour of the new dynasty, already directed all
its movements, by the advice which he found
means to transmit through a person in his confidence;
for the barricades, by which the streets
were still rendered impassable, prevented him from
going in person to the Palais Royal.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, M. de Talleyrand beheld with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
uneasiness the republicans beginning to profit by
the kind of interregnum which followed the flight
of Charles X. This party, with the perseverance
which still characterises it, were every hour gaining
ground. Already the populace, which, during the
three days had shown itself so magnanimous, so
disinterested and generous, was beginning almost
to murmur at its victory, and to lend a greedy ear
to the furious declamations of the jacobins of 1830.
A little longer hesitation, and the re-establishment
of royalty would have become a thing impossible
without another direful struggle, in which it is not
quite clear that the Orleans party would have been
victorious. Already were the piazzas and the gardens
of the Palais Royal echoing with inflammatory
appeals to the sovereign people, to stand
forth while yet it was time, and to take into its own
hands the government of what were virtually and
morally its own interests. The approaches to the
Chamber of Deputies, where the famous declaration
of the 7th of August was concocting, were crowded
with fierce and savage-looking men, calling with
bloodthirsty cries for the establishment of the Republic,
and vociferating horrible menaces against those
deputies who would dare to set up another throne;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
above all, to seat upon it another Bourbon. A
crisis was imminent. The government which was
sitting at the Palais Royal had the utmost difficulty
in restraining the people, by dint of intoxicating
its self-love and vanity with the praises bestowed
with liberal hand each morning in the journals.
The people were beginning to discover, meanwhile,
that the victory which they had gained, and for
which they were so lauded, gave them neither bread
for their starving families, nor work whereby to
earn it; and they who, after having broken the
sceptre of royalty, thought to be freed from all control,
could not support, without shuddering, the restraint
which a government, unsanctioned by the
popular voice, sought to impose upon them.</p>

<p>“Dreadful rumours of revolt and massacre were
circulated on all sides, and the family of the Duke
of Orleans were not without alarm for the very life
of its chief. The moment, then, was come at last—the
moment to decide. Charles X. was taking,
without resistance, the road to a new exile. From
that quarter, then, all danger ceased. The deputies,
now gathered together in sufficient number to deliberate,
had come to offer the crown to the lieutenant-general
of the kingdom. M. de Talleyrand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
was consulted at this crisis, and he it was who
caused the faint resistance of Louis Philippe to
cease, and induced him to place upon his brow the
crown offered by the people, and he it was whose
opinion decided the king to go at once to the
Hôtel de Ville, there to receive publicly the sceptre
of France, and to swear allegiance to the Charter.
This truth may be relied on; and, moreover, M.
de Talleyrand, in order to give to the new power
the sanction of his old experience, appeared at the
public reception of the Palais Royal for the first
time since the revolution.</p>

<p>“Such was the part played by M. de Talleyrand
in the revolution of 1830. Immense it was, if
judged by its results, but neither studied beforehand
nor rehearsed, as it has been so often unjustly
asserted since that day. This part, indeed,
was so entirely <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">impromptu</i>, that many persons of
the intimate circle of the prince know that, more
than once, M. de Talleyrand has let fall a regret
that Charles, in his blind folly, should have destroyed
in three days the whole fabric of the Restoration,
which had been looked upon by all
Europe as the masterpiece of Talleyrand’s diplomatic
works. The weakness of seigneurial pride,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
too, the only one which I think he ever possessed,
will sometimes cause him to sigh over the wreck
of that principle of legitimacy which he had been
at so much pains to re-establish in favour of the
Bourbons, a principle which he still considers
necessary to the repose of the country, perhaps
compromised for many generations by the events
of the three glorious days. The lesson which such
regrets imply, conveys, to the thinking mind, its own
moral.”</p>

<span class="subhead">SEIZURE AND CONFINEMENT OF THE SPANISH PRINCES AT VALENÇAY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>While my friend had been thus discoursing of
kings and revolutions, we had, after crossing a part
of the park, turned in the court-yard, where stood
the stables. I knew that the prince cared but
little for his stud; I was surprised, therefore, when
C. pulled the cord of the huge bell which hung at
the entrance. At the sound, the groom, who was
standing in the court, evidently knowing for what
purpose he was summoned, flung back the wide
doors of an outhouse near the gate.</p>

<p>“It is fit,” said C., laughing, “that, as our discourse
is all of chance and change, of fallen kings
and falling governments, we should now behold the
very type of these: although, fallen and faded as it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
is, it may be regarded as the great lion of
Valençay.”</p>

<p>Saying this, he stepped into the building, and I
followed, and beheld, not, as I had imagined, some
fine high-mettled racer, the gift of this or that
sovereign, presented in gratitude for the services of
the diplomate, but a sight far more interesting—a
sight which carried me back to the days of Philip V.
and Cardinal Olivarez.</p>

<p>It was the carriage which had conveyed the
Spanish princes across the frontier to Valençay, in
1808, and which they had left behind them under
peculiar circumstances. The vehicle is of most
antique and extraordinary construction. It must,
indeed, be coeval with the Spanish monarchy; a
huge, uncouth piece of Spanish workmanship, like
nothing on earth but our Lord Mayor’s state barge,
or the car of Juggernaut. The panels are emblazoned
in gold and silver, with the arms of all the
royalties of Spain, and all the quarterings thereof
besides. When new, and on a sunny day, these
panels must have blinded the beholder. The roof
is adorned in the quaint old style, with massive
cornices and rich carvings. The hangings within
and without were of crimson silk damask, and even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
the very wheels, although rude and ponderous,
were curiously wrought and richly gilt.</p>

<p>The circumstances of the huge machine having
remained at Valençay are curious and amusing.
When the morning arrived which was to send
Ferdinand and his brother forth from their place
of exile, to resume the crown and royalty in their
own land, the huge carriage which had brought
them to Valençay was drawn from its <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">remise</i>, and
laden with the moveables which had been collected
during their long captivity. There are a few persons
living now at the château, who well remember
the morning of the departure, and they will tell
you all the ludicrous circumstances connected
therewith, some of which would form valuable acquisitions
to collectors of “whims and oddities.”</p>

<p>“The day was fine: not a cloud obscured the
horizon; all nature was gay and smiling. The old
coach, roused from its long repose, and furbished
up with new hangings and velvet cushions, had
been dragged round to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">perron</i> to be loaded.
This task being accomplished, the princes and
their suite had squeezed themselves into the interior;
the little pages stood upon the steps, and
hung by the door, after a fashion which may still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>
be seen in ancient prints; and, as for the valets
and footmen, they clustered on behind, pell-mell,
clinging to each other as best they could. Some
say this ponderous machine contained at that moment
no fewer than seventeen persons. In Spain,
it had always been set in motion by eight stout
mules, but upon this occasion six brisk and capering
post-horses were attached to it, with good stout
ropes, too, for it was evident that it would require a
strong pull to get it under weigh.</p>

<p>“The beautiful princess, the fair hostess, with
her whole court, was standing on the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">perron</i>, in
picturesque and wailing grief. There were clouds
on many a youthful brow, and the tears fell like
rain from many a bright eye, for the princes had
been beloved during their long and weary captivity,
and in return they had felt a depth of gratitude
towards the soft beguilers of their weary
hours. Some there are who say that time hung not
so heavy on their hands, as it might have done had
they remained amid the dull and heavy splendours
of the Escurial. It is certain that, upon this occasion,
when they should have been joyous, they displayed
faces of such weeping melancholy at either
window of the vehicle, that you would have thought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
them going forth into exile still more dreary, instead
of being about to resume their glorious birthright.
They sobbed forth faint farewells, which
were echoed back by the weeping beauties on the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">perron</i>, until the uncle, old Don Antonio, in this
case more impatient than his youthful nephews,
urged the postillions to their greatest speed, with
promise of princely reward.</p>

<p>“At length the cry of ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">En route!</i>’ burst from
the guide; whips were cracked with energy tremendous,
and handkerchiefs waved in graceful
agitation. A louder sob burst from the ladies on
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">perron</i>—a cry of absolute despair echoed from
the carriage—the horses pulled—the postillions
shouted—they even let fly sundry choice oaths
which are ever ready at hand—the old coach
groaned and creaked—that was all—the spurs were
dug into the flinching sides of the poor animals—the
old coach swayed to and fro, and swung with a
rumbling sound—but it moved not! In vain did
both man and beast toil and pull at the cords—they
all broke one after another, and not an inch
of ground was gained.</p>

<p>“I have heard it said that no scene of the
broadest farce could surpass in ludicrous effect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
that which took place, when it was discovered that
it would be impossible, by any human means, to
drag the machine even so far as the gate of the
courtyard. The royal party were compelled to
alight forthwith. All the baggage had to be unpacked,
and they left Valençay in a much more
humble conveyance,—a good, modern travelling
carriage, belonging to the prince. I have often
wondered if Don Carlos, when fighting in his Biscayan
mountains, ever remembered that moment,
and if so, whether with a smile or with a sigh.”</p>

<p>I looked at the carriage with great interest, for
there it still remains, just as it was rolled back to
its old station under the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">remise</i>. Through all the
changes of the country from which it had rumbled
over the frontier, laden with its royal freight, has it
stood silently falling to decay—the gay emblazoned
panels blistering and fading in the damp, and the
splendid hangings all moth-eaten and falling to
tatters—a curious memento, and one which even
in our own day may find its way to some museum.
It certainly would not disgrace any collection of
“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pièces curieuses</i>,” however rare and valuable.</p>

<p>C. told me that, “not being at Valençay at the
period of the arrival of the Spanish princes, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
could not bear witness to the effect which the
sudden seizure of their persons, the breach of faith
of Napoleon, and the strict captivity in which they
were held, had produced in the country. He had,
however, seen much of them during the time of
their stay, and gave me some curious anecdotes
concerning them. Ferdinand, and his brother
Don Carlos, were both young, almost mere lads, at
the time, and, at first, as it may well be supposed,
they were overcome by grief and rage at being
thus torn from their country by fraud and violence;
but, after some little while, they grew reconciled to
their fate, and even, with true youthful volatility,
preferred it to the awful state and grandeur of the
Spanish court, which, in these days, still maintains
the same absurd etiquette that had for ages rendered
it the terror of foreign ambassadors, and gained for
it the nickname of the “grave of the gay.”</p>

<p>“It is an error to suppose that the smiles and
fascinations of the Princess de Benevent herself
had any share in this sudden change of sentiment,
for she was already past the age to captivate the
fancy of her youthful guests; but there were some
among her fair maids of honour for whom the
young princes would gladly have sworn never to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
return to Spain, not even to rule over it in splendour.</p>

<p>“They were a curious collection assembled at
Valençay. First and foremost came the two princes,
Don Ferdinand, Prince of the Asturias, and Don
Carlos, his younger brother. Of these, more anon.
Then came old Don Antonio, brother to the reigning
King of Spain, and uncle of the two boys,
guardian likewise of their welfare and their morals.
The latter was a true Spaniard of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vieille roche</i>;
such a character as may be found in the old Spanish
novels; ignorant and haughty as the hidalgo of
Columbus’s day, yet <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bonhomme</i> withal, credulous
and unsuspicious as a child.</p>

<p>“At the same time with the Spanish princes and
their suite, arrived at the château the commandant
Henri, delegate and spy of the police, commissioned
to keep close watch over the youthful heroes, and
not to suffer them to leave his sight either night or
day. I really think that the presence of this man
was the only source of uneasiness or annoyance
that the royal personages experienced during their
stay. He was a hard and vulgar individual, whose
life had been passed amid scenes of strife and treason,
and he fulfilled the duties allotted to him with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
a pertinacity and minuteness which embittered the
lives of those entrusted to his charge. Of course,
from his position about the persons of the princes,
he became at once the object of their hatred and
contempt, and if in wantonness of power he often
inflicted useless vexation, they in the wantonness
of youth managed to revenge themselves with great
ingenuity. Some of the scenes to which this state
of things gave rise were most amusing. One of the
greatest delights enjoyed by Don Ferdinand was,
at the hour of prayer, night and morning, to compel
the attendance of the commander, to whom,
from his republican and anti-religious principles,
the idea of bending to a Supreme Being was odious,
and who would growl forth his republican oaths in
cadence with the chant of the officiating priest.
He had been wounded, too, in his youth, and in his
age was stiff-jointed besides, so that to kneel was
absolute agony.</p>

<p>“Don Ferdinand would provide amusement for
the whole company, by assisting him with mock
condescension to drop upon his knees, and would
convulse them with laughter at the sly shoves and
friendly pinches which this operation would give
him the opportunity of bestowing. In vain the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
commander would seek to excuse himself from
attending at this precise hour. No excuse would
be taken; his royal charges would rather wait any
length of time than dispense with his company.
The annoyance grew so great for the poor commander,
that all his days were embittered by the
torture of that single hour, and the poor tormented
princes were amply revenged by this gentle and
gentlemanlike chastisement.</p>

<p>“Don Antonio, the dear good old soul, was at
first much admired and venerated by every one
around him, for the assiduity with which he visited
the library of the château. Many and long, indeed,
were the hours he spent there, much to the edification
of those who, beholding the utter ignorance in
which the princes had been brought up, began to
hope that so much study and meditation on the
part of the tutor would in good time turn to profit
and improvement for his pupils. But alas!
soon were the fond believers undeceived. The
good old man suddenly ceased his visits to the
library, and, on being questioned by the Princess
de Benevent as to this sudden alteration in his
mode of passing his time, he replied, with composure,
“Thank God, my work is over, and I can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
smoke my cigaretto in the shade beneath the piazza,
without the fear that the morals of my pupils may
be corrupted by those naughty books.”</p>

<p>“‘Nay,’ replied the princess, ‘if your Excellency
had but pointed out which were those you thought
objectionable, I would have had them removed;
my servants should have done it long ago, and
saved you all this trouble.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, do not mention trouble,’ replied the Don,
with calm politeness; ‘besides, removing the books
would have spoilt your library. It was only the
vile Latin authors whom I dreaded; but fortunately,
neither Don Ferdinand nor his brother can read
them, and the engravings were soon removed by
my care and trouble. I promise you, madame, not
one remains, in all those books the Prince de
Benevent pointed out to me as being those most
studied by the youth of this country.’</p>

<p>“Judge of the dismay of the princess on hearing
these words. Instant search was made among the
volumes of which he spoke, some of the most rare
and valuable editions in the whole collection. It
was too true. The pious Don, in terror for the
morals of his pupils, had taken the pains to tear
out the beautiful engravings, which in many cases<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
formed the chief value of the books. Every one
the least objectionable was gone. The beautiful
Ovid, the magnificent Strasburg Bible, and many
others of equal value, were stripped, and may be
seen to this day, as positive proofs of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ignorance
crasse</i> in which the royal family of Spain were
at that time reared.</p>

<p>“The ignorance of Don Ferdinand would have
been remarkable even in a convent of Spanish
friars. He <em>could</em> read, indeed, but made it his
boast that he never did so, having a ‘valet in his
service who understood all the mysteries of science.’
This was <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">verbatim</i> his own expression. He was
of quiet and taciturn habits, however, and loved to
spend his time in cutting out with scissors divers
little devices, with which he enclosed the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bon-bons</i>
he loved to present to the ladies of the princess’s
court. He was fond, too, of searching in books;
but it was soon discovered that Don Antonio’s
alarm was but too well founded; the royal youth
loved books for the sake of the ‘pretty pictures’
they contained, and nothing more.</p>

<p>“The younger brother, Don Carlos, was far less
gentle in his manner, and less favoured in person.
His great passion was the chase, in which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
commander loved to indulge him, as he himself
partook of the same taste.</p>

<p>“But if,” said my friend, “you would like to
know more of their deeds and doings, I will give
you a sketch of all the circumstances which took
place, from the time of their <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">enlèvement</i> at Bayonne,
to their return to Madrid. It was given me by a
gentleman of their suite. It may amuse you, and
you may read it at your leisure.”</p>

<p>Just at the moment my friend uttered this promise,
the breakfast-bell sounded a joyous peal
across the park, and we hastened to obey its
summons. C. being engaged during the morning,
gave me the paper he had promised, to amuse my
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ennui</i>, and, in the hope that its contents may afford
to others the same delight they occasioned me, I
shall give them to the reader.</p>

<p>The little manuscript which my friend placed in
my hand, had been found in the château after the
departure of the young princes of Spain from
Valençay. It was written in a fair hand, and bore
the following title:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">“<cite>The Secret History of the Intrigues, which ended
in the Seizure and Imprisonment of Ferdinand
VII. and his Brothers at Valençay.</cite>”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cahier</i> was found in the library, and as
there was but <span class="smcap smaller">ONE</span> person of the whole suite who
ever went thither, it is well known by whom it was
written, a gentleman of truth and honour, at the
very moment I am now writing this, holding a high
situation about the person of the Queen of Spain,
Isabella. The manuscript began as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In the month of March, 1807, the Prince
of Asturias, who was in active and secret correspondence
with Don Juan d’Escoïquiz, Archdeacon
and Canon of Toledo, his former preceptor, sent to
him at Toledo, where he then resided, a person in
his confidence, named Jose Marrique. The prince
forwarded by this person a letter to be delivered
into M. d’Escoïquiz’s own hand, wherein he
spoke of his suspicions concerning the ambitious
views of the Prince of the Peace, who, in consequence
of obtaining daily, either from the king or
queen, some new dignity or favour, became, more
and more powerful, particularly in possessing, as
he did, the command of the army, the navy, and
the militia. Already the rumour had arisen that
Charles IV., whose health was declining fast, had
appointed him Regent of the Kingdom. Once
regent, the death of the king would open a new<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
career to his ambition. The character of the Prince
of the Peace, and his proximity to the throne, tended
to excite alarm in the friends of the royal family.</p>

<p>“M. d’Escoïquiz, in dismay at the contents of
the prince’s letter, flattered himself that it would
be easy to undeceive the king and queen with
regard to the real character of the Prince of the
Peace. He immediately penned a letter, which
was to be delivered by the Prince of Asturias into
the hands of the queen, in which he displayed,
with great eloquence, all the danger in which the
royal family stood, by the blind confidence the
king reposed in the Prince of the Peace. This
letter, full of reason and of truth, so much alarmed
the Prince of Asturias, that he could never find
courage to present it to his mother, and he merely
copied it in his own hand. Somewhat ashamed
of his own want of resolution, he wrote to M.
d’Escoïquiz, that he judged it impossible ever to
enlighten the queen, and that he thought it would
be easier to persuade the king to reason, if he
could get an opportunity of speaking with him
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>.</p>

<p>“The worthy Canon of Toledo immediately set
about inditing another letter, which he endeavoured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
to adapt to the weak understanding of the king,
and sent it to the prince, who waited in vain for an
opportunity of giving it in private to his father.
This document was copied, like the former one,
by the prince himself, and likewise locked up in
his desk, where they were both found on the seizure
of his papers some time afterwards.</p>

<p>“The Prince of the Peace, who suspected that
the reserve and taciturn habits of the Prince of
Asturias served to conceal hostile intentions towards
himself, sought every means of undermining
the fidelity of the young prince’s household, and
made a proposition through the queen to many
him to Donna Maria Theresa, his sister-in-law,
second daughter of the Infant Don Luiz. This
princess was remarkable for her great beauty and
ambition, and had already exhibited an inclination
for gallantry. The prince, who knew but little of
her beyond her personal attractions, had already
given his consent to this union, when suddenly, the
ambition of the Prince of the Peace had become
more insatiable than ever, and the marriage was
broken off.</p>

<p>“M. d’Escoïquiz, on perceiving that every means
of gaining access to the king and queen had failed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
and that the marriage with Donna Maria had
failed also, began to imagine that the only hope of
support for the Prince of Asturias would lie in his
marriage with a princess of the family of Bonaparte.
M. d’Escoïquiz grew, in fact, quite enraptured with
the scheme, which he himself had planned, and,
wishing to preside over its execution, he left his
quiet retreat at Toledo, and came to reside at
Madrid. There he became acquainted with Count
Orquez, a gentleman much attached to the Prince
of Asturias, and communicated to him his alarms
and his future plans. In one of their secret conversations,
M. de Orquez informed him that Don
Diego Godoï, the father of the Prince of the Peace,
was distributing money among the garrison of
Madrid, and had thus corrupted a great number of
the officers. A colonel of dragoons, Don Joaquin
Jauregui, gave them intelligence of all that transpired,
and informed them that to every officer of
distinction, Godoï had said, ‘You see the miserable
state into which the kingdom has fallen—the Bourbon
dynasty is degenerated—the king cannot live
much longer—the prince is a weak, capricious fool.
Some change is necessary—we reckon on your aid.’
Throughout the whole of Madrid, the secret agents<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
of Godoï were at work night and day. The Abbé
Stata, librarian of St. Isidore, had been imprudent
enough to spread inflammatory writings, the object
of which was to prove to the Spanish nation, that
in the existing crisis, the only hope of salvation
lay in an entire confidence in the judgment and
experience of the Prince of the Peace.</p>

<p>“In this state of affairs, M. d’Escoïquiz was aware
that not a moment was to be lost, and that all true
friends of the throne must at once league together
for its defence. His first step was to obtain from the
Prince of Asturias a kind of letter of credit, which
authorized him to speak confidentially with the
Duke del’ Infantado, a young man of exalted birth,
of great integrity, and chivalrous courage, holding
a high place in public esteem. Armed with this
letter, written in the prince’s own hand, he appointed
a meeting with the duke, and together they swore
fidelity to the throne, vowing respect even to the
absurd blindness of the king, and merely concerting
the measures to be taken in the house,
when the king, whose health was declining daily,
should breathe his last, at which moment it would
be the easiest thing in the world for the Prince of
the Peace to conceal the death of the sovereign as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
long as it should please him so to do. The hatred
and suspicion which he had so craftily engendered
in the bosom of the queen against her son, had
compelled her to fill the palace with troops, all
devoted to herself and to Godoï. It was his
design when, by the rules of etiquette established
at the Spanish court, the exact moment arrived for
the heir to the throne to appear at the bedside of
the dying king, to have the young prince arrested,
and to make him sign by force the necessary
decree, which would place the whole power in the
hands of the favourite. The Duke del’ Infantado
and M. d’Escoïquiz judged then, that the only
means to guard against this outrage, would be to
provide themselves with a decree, signed and
sealed by the new king, by which the whole power,
civil and military, would be placed in the hands of
the Duke del’ Infantado, placing also beneath his
command the Prince of the Peace himself.</p>

<p>“Empowered by this decree, the Duke del’ Infantado,
on the first signification of the approaching
death of the king, was to declare his power,
take possession of all the military forces, and to
appear in the city and in the royal palaces, habited
in the costume of Generalissimo of the Kingdom,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
with full intentions to arrest immediately the Prince
of the Peace, if the conduct of the latter gave any
cause for umbrage. M. d’Escoïquiz drew up this
decree, and had it conveyed to the prince, with the
necessary instructions, begging him to copy it with
his own hand, and to fix his own seal upon the
paper. The prince complied with the whole of
those directions, and the letter was placed at once
in the hands of the Duke del’ Infantado, who was
to preserve it carefully until the moment arrived
when it would be required. The act was complete,
signed according to Spanish usage, ‘<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Yo el Re</i>,’
and a vacant space left for the date, which was to
be filled up by the Duke del’ Infantado at the
moment of the King’s death.</p>

<p>“About the middle of the month of June, M.
d’Escoïquiz received another letter from the Prince
of Asturias; in it was announced that, through the
medium of Don Juan Emanuel de Villena, his first
equerry, he had received an important billet, signed
by Don Pedro Giraldo, tutor to the Infant Don
Francisco, and that this billet was written by an
individual belonging to the French Legation. It
contained the announcement of a most important
and secret communication, which it was the wish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
of the French ambassador, M. de Beauharnais, to
make to the prince. M. d’Escoïquiz, whom the
latter had consulted with regard to the line of conduct
which he ought to adopt, was of opinion that
the prince’s reply should be peremptory—that ‘he
meddled not with public affairs, nor held interviews
with public men.’ Meanwhile, he undertook to discover
if the message really came from the French
ambassador, or was merely a trap laid by Godoï
to condemn the young prince. This tried and
valued friend, never at a loss, had soon invented a
pretext to call upon the ambassador, to whom he
was unknown. He requested permission to present
to M. l’Ambassadeur the first volume of an
epic poem, to be entitled ‘The Conquest of Mexico.’</p>

<p>“The ambassador, without appearing surprised
at the sudden literary reputation usurped by
M. d’Escoïquiz, answered with courtesy that he
would receive with pleasure the book and its author.
After a few observations relating to ‘the Conquest
of Mexico,’ some few remarks on the state of
affairs bringing each of them nearer to the object
they both had in view, M. d’Escoïquiz frankly
questioned the ambassador on the subject of the
billet which had been delivered to the Prince of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
Asturias, and begged him, as a point of honour, to
tell him the truth concerning it.</p>

<p>“The ambassador feigned a certain embarrassment,
denied being the author of the billet, yet
wished it to be understood that in reality he was;
said that a message from an ambassador to the
heir-apparent would scarcely have been admissible,
but declared he felt much esteem for his royal
highness, and that he would be greatly pleased by
the permission to pay his court, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en particulier</i>, to
the young prince. By all this specious reasoning
M. d’Escoïquiz judged of the truth, and at once
told him, without further disguise, that the prince
firmly believed that the message came from him.</p>

<p>“‘Then why have you not brought me a <em>written</em>
message in return?’ said M. de Beauharnais, involuntarily
betraying himself; whereupon M. d’Escoïquiz,
laughing, replied, ‘That <em>written messages
could be denied</em>, therefore a preconcerted signal
would, in his opinion, be more efficacious;’ and,
before the conclusion of the interview, it was agreed
that, as the court was in a few days to return to
Madrid, the ambassador would present himself, as
usual, at the head of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corps diplomatique</i> at the
reception of his royal highness, and that the prince<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
would ask him ‘<em>if he had ever been at Naples?</em>’
and that, on turning as he would leave him, to
pass to another ambassador, he would take his
handkerchief from his pocket and wave it as he
passed.</p>

<p>“On the 1st of July, the ambassadors were received
by his royal highness, who supported
M. d’Escoïquiz by giving the preconcerted signal.
Two days after this, M. d’Escoïquiz had another
interview with M. de Beauharnais, who bade him
rely on the sentiments of affection which Napoleon
had ever felt towards the Prince of Asturias, and
his readiness to maintain his cause against the
Prince of the Peace. It was then that M. d’Escoïquiz
thought it proper to bring forward the question
concerning the marriage, and even went so far
as to leave to Napoleon the choice of the princess
of his own family whom he would prefer to place
upon the throne of Spain. The utmost secrecy
was sworn to on both sides, M. de Beauharnais
promising to write immediately to Paris, in order
that proper measures might be taken with regard
to the king, so as to prevent any imputation of intrigue
being laid to the charge of his son.</p>

<p>“In consequence of the surveillance which was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
exercised by Godoï over every movement of the
French ambassador, it was agreed that M. de Beauharnais
and M. d’Escoïquiz were to meet for the
first interview in a secluded spot of the gardens of
the Retiro. It was about twenty days afterwards
that M. d’Escoïquiz received an intimation that he
would be expected during the hour of siesta, when
they would have little fear of surprise, at the place
which had been appointed. Here M. d’Escoïquiz
learnt, with the greatest astonishment, that the
answer which the ambassador had received from
Napoleon was perfectly puerile and insignificant,
never even alluding to the marriage; and M. de
Beauharnais, attributing this silence to the absence
of any <em>written</em> communication on the part of the
young prince, advised M. d’Escoïquiz to persuade
him to write directly to Napoleon. (Was this
a snare?) It is certain that M. de Beauharnais
<em>must</em> have received some positive instructions,
which he did not choose to reveal until the prince
had further committed himself, and he suffered
M. d’Escoïquiz to return to Toledo in disgust.</p>

<p>“It was on the 30th September, 1807, that M.
d’Escoïquiz received a letter from the ambassador,
in which were quoted, as an extract from a private<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
communication of Napoleon’s, the following words,
each underlined: ‘<em>I beg not, neither do I sell—I
act not without security. Have you received any
official communication touching this affair?</em>’ The
forms of political quackery employed in this letter
induced M. d’Escoïquiz once more to return to
Madrid; again did he meet the ambassador at the
Retiro; again did M. de Beauharnais endeavour to
persuade M. d’Escoïquiz to prevail upon the prince
to write directly to Napoleon; and the good canon,
having the welfare of the prince at heart, yielded
at last, and promised that such a letter should be
written.</p>

<p>“Now, the Prince of the Peace was all this time
perfectly aware of everything that was passing in
the house of the ambassador, through the medium
of the spies with whom the latter was surrounded,
and he caused the king immediately to write, himself,
to Napoleon, which epistle was instantly despatched
to the Spanish ambassador in Paris, the
Prince de Masserano, with orders to convey it, the
very moment of its arrival, to the emperor, in whatever
place he might chance to be. It was natural
enough that, with the dilatory character of the
Prince of Asturias, his father’s letter should arrive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
long before his own. It reached the emperor at
Fontainebleau, and excited much astonishment and
indignation. It was full of bitter reproach against
Napoleon for having encouraged a secret correspondence
with the young heir to the Spanish
throne, telling him beforehand of the despatch he
was about to receive from the prince, <em>and of all that
the letter would contain</em>.</p>

<p>“That letter was full of protestations of devotion
to Napoleon, and of admiration of his brilliant
qualities, of the before-mentioned proposal of marriage,
and of supplications to the emperor to aid in
rescuing the country from the hands of the Prince
of the Peace. It was upon the strength of this
letter that the Prince of the Peace, gained over by
Napoleon, persuaded the old king to allow of the
entry of French troops, ostensibly to compel Portugal
to separate her cause from that of England—it
being understood that it was merely as a passage
to that country that these troops were allowed to
cross the line.</p>

<p>“On the 27th of October, at ten o’clock at night,
the Prince of Asturias was arrested in the Palace
of the Escurial, under the accusation of having
conspired to rob his father of the throne, and of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
having sought to assassinate him. The act of
arrest went on to say, that these particulars had
come to the knowledge of the king <em>through an
unknown channel</em>, and that he would be tried for
the crime of high treason. M. d’Escoïquiz and
the Duke del’ Infantado were arraigned as accomplices.
They were confined in the dungeons of
the Escurial, deprived of all communication with
each other, or with the world without, and two sentinels
were stationed at the door of each cell.</p>

<p>“During the process of the prince, the number
of French troops had increased to more than
double. It was observed that they had taken up
positions entirely contrary to the direction they had
professed to follow, and that they were each day
drawing nearer to Madrid, and the people, in every
country more clear-sighted than its rulers, began
to feel alarm at the intrusion. It was necessary
to give some diplomatic explanations concerning
these singular marches, but these were so ill received,
that the Prince of the Peace was compelled
to order back the Spanish regiments already on
their road to Portugal. The ambassador feigned
total ignorance, and, after the lapse of a few days,
received instructions to say that, by commanding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>
the retrograde movement, the Prince of the Peace
must be prepared to allow of an increase of French
forces. In the fear of a counter-order, these latter
troops, by forced marches, soon took possession of
the whole frontier of Catalonia, Navarre, and Guipuscoa.
The court wishing to appear free from
anxiety, negotiations went on as usual between the
two governments. Meanwhile, the country was
invaded, and the Prince of the Peace began to lose
somewhat of his overweening confidence in the
disinterested friendship of Napoleon, but, like all
weak-minded persons, thought that everything
would be saved by gaining time. He accordingly
proposed a journey into Andalusia on the 13th of
March, and that very same night he gave orders
for departure; but it was impossible to keep the
preparations so secret as to escape the observation
of some of the hangers-on who always throng
about royal palaces. The orders all along the road
for relays of horses, the departure of the luggage,
the sudden disappearance of Madame Yudo, with
her children, all these circumstances united, had
produced an uneasiness among the people, and
roused the feeling of hatred and indignation towards
the Prince of the Peace, which had slumbered,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
but had never been extinguished, and it was
declared that he was counselling the king to desert
Madrid.</p>

<p>“In these popular movements, it needs but a
spark to light the brand, and in less time than
could be conceived possible, a crowd had assembled
before Godoï’s residence, with loud and furious
cries demanding justice on the oppressor of the
people. Godoï escaped, thanks to his foresight in
preparing for a day of reckoning. He had planned
and accomplished a secret retreat beneath the roof
of his palace, where he remained concealed while
the work of pillage and devastation was going on
around him. It was not till the 19th, that he was
discovered by a sentinel, who could not be bribed
to facilitate his flight. He was secured, and conveyed
through the streets in a piteous plight.</p>

<p>“The king, justly deeming that the Prince of
Asturias would have greater influence with the
crowd than himself, was reduced to implore his
son to intercede in favour of the unfortunate
minister. This the prince, with true Christian
feeling, in spite of all cause of grievance which he
himself had to complain of, immediately consented
to do; and, suddenly appearing on the balcony of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
the palace, he promised the assembled multitude
that, if they would disperse, the Prince of the
Peace should be tried and judged according to the
law. This address had the desired effect; the
crowd retired, and Godoï was taken prisoner to the
barracks of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">gardes du corps</i>, where, by one of
those strange coincidences by which it would appear
as if Providence sought to remind ambitious
men of a day of retribution, he was locked up in
the very chamber which he had occupied when a
simple private soldier in that identical corps.</p>

<p>“It was after this event that the Prince of
Asturias was received into favour, and with him,
the friends who had been so devoted to his cause.
M. d’Escoïquiz was appointed to superintend all the
negotiations with the French ambassador, as it was
thought in council that M. de Beauharnais, after
what had taken place, would find himself more at
ease with M. d’Escoïquiz than with any other of
its members.”</p>

<p>It was immediately after these events that
Charles IV., by his own spontaneous act, abdicated
the throne in favour of his son, who took
his father’s place as Ferdinand VII. All the circumstances
which followed are fully detailed in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
work of M. de Pradt, and need not be repeated
here. The details of the manuscript tally in every
respect with those given by that author, and I shall
therefore content myself with giving to the reader
the gossiping portion of the narrative; the hitherto
<em>unpublished</em> history of one of the most striking and
audacious <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coups-de-main</i> of modern history.</p>

<p>“From this hour was that <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup-de-main</i> evidently
planned and meditated, and one scarcely
knows which to admire most—the fond and simple
security of the Spaniards, or the boldness and contempt
of all social respect which characterized the
proceedings of the French. The ambassador announced
at length the arrival of the Emperor Napoleon
at Bordeaux, and was pleased to renew the
protestations of friendship on the part of his
master, with which he had already beguiled the
faith and credulity of the poor young Prince of
Asturias. It was not, however, until the 8th of
April that King Ferdinand decided on despatching
his young brother, Don Carlos, to meet the
emperor, with instructions to proceed even to Paris,
should he fail to meet him on the road. Don
Carlos was the bearer of a letter from Ferdinand to
Napoleon, in which, after speaking of the strict<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
alliance which it was the interest of both countries
to maintain, and having again urged the subject of
his marriage with one of the emperor’s nieces, he
announced his intention of going forward to meet
his imperial majesty, as soon as he should have
approached the frontiers of Spain.</p>

<p>“Don Carlos took his departure on the 9th of
April. The news of the departure of the emperor
from Paris, reached Madrid on the 11th. Ferdinand,
meanwhile, worn out with the persecutions
of the Grand-duke of Berg and General Savary,
quitted Madrid, for Burgos, on the 14th. His
council advised him to this measure; perceiving
that he had not the means either of attack or defence,
it was thought to be the wisest plan to
throw himself into the arms of Napoleon.</p>

<p>“It was now observed that not a single negotiation
had taken place with the new king, and that
he had not been formally acknowledged by Napoleon,
who had never taken the trouble to answer
any of his letters, and now, too late, it was beginning
to be feared that the frequent conferences
which had taken place between Charles IV., the
queen, and the Grand-duke of Berg, through the
medium of the Queen of Etruria, had for their only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
aim the replacing of Charles upon the throne,
by causing him to protest against the act of
abdication. This secret intrigue, of which M. de
Monthion, adjutant-general, had been the messenger,
and the Queen of Etruria the instrument,
produced the act of the 21st of April, in which
Charles IV. speaks thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“‘I protest and declare that my decree of the
19th of March, by which I abdicated the throne in
favour of my son, was extorted from me by force,
and the desire of preventing great disorder in my
kingdom, and the effusion of the blood of my well-beloved
people, and ought therefore to be regarded
as an act null and void.</p>

<p class="sigright">“‘<span class="smcap">Yo el Rey.</span>’</p></blockquote>

<p>“The natural consequence of this protest was of
course the application to Napoleon for help against
his son, thus pronounced a rebel and usurper.
Ferdinand had authorized a junta, under the
presidency of his uncle Don Antonio, to take
charge of the government during his absence. He
had with him a single squadron of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">gardes du
corps</i>; and two companies of foot had orders to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
await him at Burgos. He was three days upon the
road, and found every post occupied by French
troops, among which he could not discern a single
Spanish soldier. At Burgos, he found Marshal
Bessières, in command of 10,000 men. The marshal
courteously offered the use of the relays which
had been provided for Napoleon, for the conveyance
of Ferdinand to Vittoria, which offer was
accepted. Here the unfortunate prince found a
corps composed of two hundred dragoons, and a
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">compagnie d’élite</i> of fifty gendarmes, commanded
by Colonel Fleury.</p>

<p>“The prince remained three days at Vittoria,
and lodged at the Hotel de Ville. Savary grew
impatient at this long delay; his orders were to
bring the prince on to Bayonne, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">nolens volens</i>.
Every measure had been taken to carry him off
on the 19th, if he had not listened to the last endeavour
at persuasion on the 18th. But the king
removed every difficulty, by announcing his intention
of once more setting forward on his journey.
At nine o’clock on the morning of the 19th, at the
moment of his getting into the carriage, a popular
instinct had drawn together a vast concourse of
people at the door of the Hôtel de Ville; a universal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
cry of execration arose from the multitude
as the young prince mounted the vehicle; the
traces were cut, and the mules unharnessed. Ferdinand
was compelled to harangue the populace,
and succeeded in quieting them by assurances of
his perfect safety; the furious cries which had
been heard gave place to tears, and, soon afterwards,
he was allowed to depart; but in consequence
of the delay, did not arrive at Irun until
eleven o’clock at night.</p>

<p>“Here the king and his brother were lodged at
the house of M. d’Alozabal, outside the town, and
they were guarded by a Spanish regiment. General
Savary did not arrive at Irun until the 20th,
at seven in the morning, owing to an accident
which occurred to his carriage. Thus the king
and his council were left for eight hours alone,
without their French escort, guarded by Spanish
troops, in the house of a Spaniard, situated on the
sea-shore, where a number of boats were lying
attached to stakes planted at the bottom of the
garden. General Savary, immediately on his
arrival, rushed like a terrified culprit to the house
where the king had alighted. Oh, joy!—he found
him still sleeping quietly in his bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
“At eight o’clock, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cortège</i> set out for
Bayonne, and in that place was accomplished one
of the most extraordinary events which, perhaps,
has ever taken place in the history of nations. At
the moment when the king passed over the frontier,
the carriage was surrounded by detachments
of the imperial guard. Their numbers appeared
rather extraordinary for a mere guard of honour.
This reflection, vague enough on its first adoption,
changed to a sinister foreboding, when, on passing
beneath the triumphal arch which had been thrown
across the road, they beheld the following words
inscribed amidst the boughs of laurel with which it
was decorated:—‘He who can make and destroy
Kings at pleasure is himself more than a King.’</p>

<p>“Now were the princes of Spain beyond the
jurisdiction of their own country, and in the power
of Napoleon. Between Vivau and Bayonne, Ferdinand
found the Infant Don Paulo, who, with
three Spanish noblemen, had come to greet his
unhappy brother. The king requested them to
join him in his carriage, and then he learned, with
the greatest surprise, that Napoleon himself had
declared to them on the day before, at <em>ten in the
morning</em>, that they might never expect to return to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
Madrid, and that one of his own brothers was
about to occupy the throne of Spain. I have
marked the hour at which this declaration had
taken place, because it must have taken eighteen
hours to get the news conveyed to Irun, and at
Irun, as we have seen, there had been ample time
and opportunity for the escape of the princes.</p>

<p>“Nothing was left but resignation to their fate;
the carriage was drawing near to Bayonne; at
half-past twelve o’clock, the princes arrived in the
good old city, and, a few moments afterwards, the
king received a visit from Napoleon in person. In
this interview, doubtless by design, the conversation
was insignificant, excepting that it was observed
that, in the style of Napoleon’s address to
the king, there existed an affectation of addressing
him in the third person, using the pronoun <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">elle</i>,
which might be applicable in the French language
either to majesty or royalty.</p>

<p>“Ferdinand hastened to pay his respects to
Napoleon, in grateful homage for this first visit,
and the emperor invited him to dine at the Château
de Maroc. The Dukes de San Carlos, de Medina
Cœli, and del’ Infantado, were also invited. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
Prince de Neufchâtel was the only Frenchman
present at this dinner.</p>

<p>“On the next day, Napoleon granted a private
audience to M. d’Escoïquiz, and bade him comprehend
that he was determined to alter the dynasty
which had sat upon the throne of Spain; forgetting
that he had a thousand times declared that his
own existence was incompatible with the fact of
any sovereign of the house of Bourbon being allowed
to remain on any of the thrones of Europe.
He alleged in excuse of his proceedings the proclamation
of the Spanish government at the period
of the battle of Jena, which proclamation, he said,
had been regarded in France as a measure of war.
He then added, in a loud, fierce voice, that it
would be useless to seek to alter his determination,
for that nothing on earth could make him change.
He paused after the utterance of these terrible
words, and then spoke, in a softened voice, of the
misfortunes into which the young princes had
fallen, and regretted for their sakes that he was
compelled to take such harsh measures, wishing
them to be assured that nothing but the necessity
of perfecting his system could have induced him to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
behave thus hardly towards them. He even went
so far as to offer to the young king, upon condition
that he would renounce all pretensions to the
Crown of Spain, the kingdom of Etruria, with one
year’s revenue, to be spent in forming a household,
one of his nieces in marriage, and, in case he himself
died without heirs, a right to share his property
with his younger brothers.</p>

<p>“M. d’Escoïquiz, who was a brave and clever
man, answered to all this disloyal cant as became
a Spaniard and a gentleman, without acrimony
and without passion, stating that it was not in the
power of the emperor to compensate the king for
the loss of the crown of which he was depriving
him, and appealing at great length to every feeling
of honour and humanity in the emperor’s bosom.
Napoleon listened to all without betraying the
slightest mark of impatience, but merely replied
that he had been for a long time engaged in examining
the question on every side; that his present
determination was dictated by the <em>system</em>
which he had in view, and which, although against
the feelings of his heart, he must continue to persevere
in. The canon then retired. The result
of his visit was submitted to the other friends of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
Ferdinand. M. de Cevallos was <em>alone</em> of opinion
that every proposition of Napoleon should be refused,
and that all communication between the two
sovereigns should be suspended; and he exacted,
seeing the great responsibility which the council
was incurring with the Spanish nation, that each
member should certify his opinion in writing.</p>

<p>“Is it not strange that the courage of these
men should have been roused just at the moment
when they had need of nought but resignation?
But so it was: their Spanish pride had taken umbrage
at last, and the Duke del’ Infantado was
commissioned to announce to Napoleon the prince’s
intention of naming a plenipotentiary to negotiate
in writing every subject which it might be the
emperor’s pleasure to have discussed. The proceeding
of Napoleon on this occasion was highly
characteristic of the man. He sent for M. d’Escoïquiz,
and told him, in blunt and coarse language,
that, if before eleven o’clock that night the
councillors did not bring the formal renunciation
of Ferdinand to the throne of Spain, and the formal
demand of that of Etruria, he would treat with
Charles IV., who was to arrive on the morrow.
M. de Cevallos implored the young king not to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
accede to any proposition of Napoleon; but, the
day after, M. d’Escoïquiz ventured to speak again
concerning Tuscany, when Napoleon answered
abruptly, ‘Par Dieu, mon cher, il n’est plus
temps!’</p>

<p>“On the 30th, at four in the afternoon, Charles
IV. and the queen, arrived at Bayonne. Napoleon
had despatched one of his chamberlains to compliment
them at Irun. In the same carriage with
the king was the Princess d’Alcudia, daughter of
the Prince of the Peace. The entry of the king
and queen was most brilliant. The princes were
allowed to go forward to meet them, and returned
to Bayonne in their suite.</p>

<p>“The arrival of Charles completely altered the
face of things. He consented to all that was required
of him. Napoleon sent a message, through
M. d’Escoïquiz, to Ferdinand, to the effect that,
as King Charles IV. had refused to adhere to his
abdication, it was the duty of the Prince of Asturias
to give in his renunciation at the instant. The
young prince, through weakness, consented to this
mark of respect to his father, although aware that
in this proposition some sinister design of Napoleon
must be concealed. The first act of authority<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
on the part of Charles was to name the Grand-duke
of Berg lieutenant-general of the kingdom,
thus excluding Don Antonio, who had been called
to Bayonne by an order of Charles himself. Don
Antonio had yielded without a murmur; and an
aide-de-camp of the Grand-duke of Berg escorted
him to Bayonne, where he arrived on the 25th.
He had incurred some danger on the road, for the
people had unharnessed the mules of his carriage
at Tolosa, and thrown down cart-loads of rubbish
on the bridge. Don Antonio had owed his safety
entirely to the courage of the captain of cuirassiers
who commanded his escort.</p>

<p>“Soon after the arrival of Don Antonio, the
Queen of Etruria joined the royal party, bringing
with her the Infant Don Francisco. It was at this
moment that the princes were greeted with the astounding
information that they were immediately
to depart as prisoners for Valençay, and here they
arrived on the 18th of May.</p>

<p>“Their entrance into the château will never be
forgotten, for it left upon the mind of every beholder
the most singular impression. The princes
(all excepting Don Antonio) were young, and
blooming with health and innocence, while everything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
about them, the habiliments which they wore,
the carriages which conveyed them, the liveries of
their attendants, brought back the memory of past
centuries. The very coach from which they
alighted might have belonged to Philip V. This
air of antiquity reminded the bystanders of their
grandeur, and rendered their position still more
interesting. They were the first Bourbons who
had touched the soil of France after so many years
of troubles and disasters, and it was with tears that
they were received. The Princess de Talleyrand
and the ladies of her suite crowded round to greet
them on their arrival, and by their attentions succeeded
in diverting the grief which they expressed
at this cruel and unjustifiable exile. It was the
object of every inhabitant of the château to render
this exile as easy to be borne as possible.</p>

<p>“On the very morrow of their arrival, the young
princes were assured by all they saw, that Napoleon
reigned not either in the château or in the
park of Valençay. No one was permitted to appear
before them without an order from themselves, and
it was agreed that no one should approach them
save in court costume. Such marks of honour and
respect were pleasing to young men who had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
brought up amid the ceremony and etiquette of the
Escurial. Every hour of the day was allotted to
some pursuit. In the morning, mass at the chapel—then
the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">siesta</i>—then driving or riding in the
park, and then again to prayer. In a few days,
the young princes found themselves more at home
than they had ever done in their father’s palace at
Madrid. They had never been accustomed even
to go out to take an airing without a ceremonious
permission from the king; they had never been
allowed even to walk together, it not being etiquette
for more than one royal prince to be absent from
the palace at a time. It is a singular fact, that the
amusements of the chase, riding on horseback, and
dancing, had been strictly prohibited at the court
of Spain. It was at Valençay that Ferdinand fired
his first shot.</p>

<p>“The young princes were all delighted at the
change in their habits, and at the kindness with
which they were surrounded. The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">garde de chasse</i>
who accompanied them through the park, had
served the Prince de Condé; the riding-master who
was employed to teach them to ride, had been for
years in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">grande ecurie</i>, and had given instructions
to Madame Elizabeth; so that they were constantly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
reminded of individuals of their own family.
Boucher, the cook, was continually employed in
concocting detestable Spanish ollas. The terrace
before the château was converted for their amusement
into a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salle de bal</i>, where they would sometimes
join in those dances of their country, which
require no art to follow the movements or the step.
Guitars were left in every corner of the garden, and
the kind-hearted Dussek himself would devote his
time and talent to the execution of simple Spanish
airs, which they would love to hear, as being the
only music they could understand.</p>

<p>“But all these amusements were only minor
points of interest in the history of their lives. It
was at the hour of prayer, when the bell of the chapel
rang at sunset, that all the etiquette of Spanish form
was most strictly adhered to. Every soul in the
château, whether visitor, attendant, gaoler, or guard,
was compelled to attend at the chapel; and it was
really a touching sight to behold prisoners and
gaolers, oppressors and oppressed, kneeling together
before the same God, laying aside their
bitterness and enmities before Him who was one
day to judge them all.”</p>

<p>During this period of uncertainty, while his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
European allies were still dubious as to the manner
in which his brother Joseph would be received as
king of Spain, Napoleon was in a state of constant
terror and alarm with regard to the prisoners
of Valençay; he could not hear of the place, nor
of the persons who inhabited it, without giving
way to transports of rage, and to the utterance of
injurious epithets concerning those whom he had
already wronged and oppressed. One day, the
young prince received a billet, couched in the following
terms: ‘Prince Ferdinand, in writing to me,
addresses me as his cousin. Let him understand
that such address is ridiculous, and let him henceforth
simply call me “<span class="smcap">Sire</span>.”’</p>

<p>“From this time forward, the existence of the
princes seemed to have been forgotten; and all
that can be said of them during the five years that
they spent at Valençay is, that they existed. The
treaty which fixed their departure to Spain was
negotiated at Valençay, and they left the place
full of unspeakable gratitude for the kindness and
princely generosity of its owner.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Just as I had finished the reading of this tale of
wonder, C. entered the room. “What think you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
of this strange statement?” said he. “The history
of your own country, all wild and furious as
it is, cannot offer an example of such audacity as
this.” I was fain humbly to confess our inferiority
in these matters. “But know you,” said I, “the
opinion of Prince Talleyrand with regard to this
affair?”</p>

<p>“He has been calumniated even in this,” was
C.’s reply, “and accused of having advised the
measure; whereas his indignation on learning from
Napoleon himself the step which had been taken,
dictated the boldest and most eloquent speech
which, perhaps, ever fell from his lips: ‘Sire,’ said
he, warmly, ‘a young man of family (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">un enfant
de famille</i>) may gamble away his last farthing—the
heritage of his ancestors—the dower of his
mother—the portion of his sisters—and yet be
courted and admired for his wit—be sought for his
talents or distinction—but let him once be detected
in <em>cheating</em> at the game, and he is lost—society is
for ever shut against him.’ With these words he
turned upon his heel, leaving the emperor pale
and quivering with rage, and vowing vengeance
against the bold speaker of the unwholesome truth.
Such was the real opinion of the Prince de Talleyrand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
concerning this unprincipled transaction—the
expression of the man who has been accused,
not only of having been the instigator of the whole
proceeding, but of having aided in its execution.
‘Et voilà comme on écrit l’histoire!’”</p>

<span class="subhead">CAGLIOSTRO—VOLTAIRE—THE MARQUIS DE J——.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It was the hour of noon, and C. had kindly
come to fetch me to the luncheon-room, where I
found the guests all assembled, listening greedily
to the conversation of the prince, who was that
morning <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en verve</i>, and relating with great good-nature
the anecdotes which he had promised us on
the preceding evening; the first claimant to be
satisfied was, of course, by right, the youthful
duchess, to whom he had held out hopes of the
history of his famous visit to the great Cagliostro,
and which I will give to the reader.</p>

<p>“It was just at the dawning of the new lights
which had arisen on the political horizon,” began
the prince, “or rather, I should say, perhaps, with
more justice, at the first extinguishing of the old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>
beacons which had served to guide our ancestors
for ages, that so many new doctrinaires and charlatans
of every kind came swarming in crowds to
Paris. Those were, indeed, most troublous times.
Every brain seemed reeling with political vertigo—every
heart seemed to beat thick and fast, with
an ardour hitherto unknown in the annals of any
country on the face of the globe. With the warm
and passionate temperaments, enthusiasm had
reached to frenzy, while, with the cold and passionless,
it smouldered, a hidden fire, ready to
burst out into lurid flame upon the first occasion
of excitement.</p>

<p>“Among the many quacks and impostors who
abounded at the time, none was more conspicuous
than the famous Cagliostro. He had arrived from
Italy under extraordinary and mysterious circumstances;
his coming had been preceded by rumours
more strange, more surprising still, and his door
was besieged at once by all the rich and idle, the
marvel-loving portion of the population of Paris.
Among the rest, I am ashamed to confess that I
was one of the most ardent. I was very young at
the time, and had not acquired that distrust of all
pretension which years alone can give. Many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
months, however, had elapsed before I could obtain
the audience I so much coveted. Thousands
of persons had to pass by right before me, and it
was said that, immediately on his arrival, his books
were so filled with the names of the highest and
mightiest, that, had he been <em>just</em>, and received
them each <em>in turn</em>, the candidates at the <em>bottom</em>
of the list would have known their future by experience
long before he could by any possible means
have foretold it.</p>

<p>“I myself knew an officer in the regiment de
Flandre, who, being quartered at Metz, and not
being able to obtain from his colonel leave of absence,
threw up his commission, in order to keep
his appointment with Cagliostro on a certain day
in Paris, so fearful was he of losing the valuable
information concerning the future, which the magician
had to give him.</p>

<p>“I cannot even now repress a smile, when I
remember the awe and terror with which I entered
the presence of the conjuror. I had not dared
to go alone; M. de Boufflers had kindly consented
to accompany me; and yet my embarrassment was
not wholly dissipated even with the prospect of his
company; so fearful was I of missing the object<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
of my visit, that I had wasted so much time in
thinking of all the questions which I meant to propound
to him, as to have even written many of
them upon my <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">calpin</i>, with the intention of consulting
it in case of need. It was already dusk
when we were admitted into the awful presence of
the conjuror; not quite dark without doors, yet
sufficiently so within to require the aid of tapers.
The antechamber was filled with impatient applicants,
who railed at us as we passed through the
door of the chamber where the wizard was holding
his incantations. The whole scene was very like
those introduced in the early Spanish dramas, and
inspired one with the most awful forebodings as to
what was about to follow.</p>

<p>“We found the magician in his study. He was
just at the moment engaged in dismissing two poor
patients, to whom he had given advice gratuitously.
The one was a cripple figure, whose distorted and
haggard countenance formed a most fitting accessory
to the scene of devilry; the other was an old
mendicant friar, afflicted with the shaking palsy,
whose restless limbs and hesitating speech made
him appear as if under the influence of some wizard
spell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
“As soon as we entered, Cagliostro led his guests
to a door at the farther end of the chamber, which
was veiled by a thick tapestry, and, opening it
without the slightest noise, ushered them through it
into the passage beyond, and then, closing it again
with the same attention to silence, returned to the
spot where we were standing, and, placing his finger
on his lips, pointed towards a still and motionless
figure seated in one corner of the room, and which,
from the obscurity that reigned around, we had
not observed on our entrance. The figure was
that of a female, covered from head to foot with a
veil of black crape, so long and ample that it disguised
even the form of the fauteuil in which she
was seated.</p>

<p>“Cagliostro bade us take seats at a table covered
with green velvet, upon which were placed divers
mysterious-looking instruments of torture, sundry
queer-shaped bottles and diabolical volumes, and
then, standing up before us, in solemn and biblical
language inquired wherefore we had sought him,
and what it was that we desired to know. Such
was the effect of the sudden questioning, the
mystery of the interview, the silence and the darkness,
that Boufflers, who was to have spoken first,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
and who had the reputation of being a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">raffiné de
premier ordre</i>, a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">roué de la Régence</i>, was quite
overawed by the whole scene, and could find no
words to answer the summons, but sat stammering
and hesitating, while I took the opportunity of
examining slowly and at leisure the wondrous
adept.</p>

<p>“Cagliostro was then a man in the very flower
of his age, of exceedingly prepossessing appearance.
His person, although small, was so well and firmly
knit that its proportions seemed those of a much
larger man. His countenance was remarkably
keen and penetrating, being formed of a succession
of sharp angular lines, which gave him a look
of cunning that he would willingly have disguised,
and with which the solemn tone and mysterious
aspect were altogether at variance. His sharp
piercing eyes I shall never forget; they absolutely
seemed to light up the obscurity of the chamber,
and, as they flashed from the one to the other of
his visitors, they seemed to belong to some wild
bird of prey hesitating between two victims which
to devour first. His beard and eyebrows were
black and bushy, with here and there a streak of
grey amid their jetty blackness, telling more of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
the hand of woe than of the passage of time.
When we entered, he had upon his head a velvet
cap, which, with gentlemanlike courtesy, he doffed
when he addressed us, and then I perceived that
the summit of his crown was already bald, although
his hair curled downward upon his neck and shoulders
in a thick and silky mass. The hand which
rested upon the table, and upon which he seemed
to be leaning his whole weight as he stood in
graceful and theatrical attitude, awaiting our communication,
was small and delicate as that of a lady
of the court, and shone out upon the dark green
velvet as white as snow; and yet it needed not any
very profound knowledge of anatomy to enable the
beholder to discern at once that it was the hand of
a man possessed of most herculean strength and
power, so vigorous were the firm knit muscles, so
well strung the tightened, cord-like nerves. I think
he observed with some displeasure the curiosity
with which I gazed towards it, for he withdrew it
suddenly, and let it fall by his side.</p>

<p>“Boufflers still remaining mute, the conjuror
turned to me, and asked me, in a voice which had
already lost much of its solemnity, and partook of
something like harshness, if I also had come unprepared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
with a subject of consultation, as, if so,
we had best depart at once, and leave the field to
others whose business might be of more importance,
and who were waiting with such impatience
without. The question roused all the courage
which was left within me, for I began to fear that
the magician might grow wearied, and dismiss us
as he threatened, and I answered in a low voice
that I wished to consult him concerning the health
of a person who was dear to me. (I had already
forgotten all the questions I had intended to propound,
as well as the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">calpin</i> which I had so laden
with notes.)</p>

<p>“Cagliostro turned, and by a movement so
abrupt and sudden that it made us both start to
our feet, drew the fauteuil wherein was seated the
veiled mysterious form of the female who had remained
all this time silent and motionless, across
the floor, and still the figure moved not. The feet
resting on a board attached to the bottom of the
fauteuil, moved with the rest, producing an indescribable
effect. At the present day, when the
mysteries of mesmerism have become common
household talk, and somnambulism has been made
a general <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">voie de guerison</i> for every complaint<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span>
under heaven, all this will appear vain and puerile
ceremony; but, at the period of which I am now
speaking, they were familiar but to the initiated few,
and Boufflers and I, poor ignorant novices, were
struck with awe and wonder.</p>

<p>“‘What is it you seek to know?’ said Cagliostro,
resuming once more his solemn and theatrical air,
and, drawing a little aside the veil of black crape,
he bent towards the ear of the female, and whispered
a few words which we could not understand.</p>

<p>“I was so afraid at the moment of losing, as my
friend Boufflers had already done, the memory of
what I had to say, that I replied hurriedly, never
thinking of myself, nor of the thousand and one
questions which I had predetermined to ask—‘I
wish to learn the cause of the migraine of my friend
the Marquise de ——’</p>

<p>“‘Chut,’ interrupted Cagliostro. ‘The name is
of little import. What see you?’ added he, in a
loud deep tone, turning to the veiled figure.</p>

<p>“‘I see a fair and beauteous lady,’ replied a
sweet soft voice from beneath the veil. ‘She is
attired in a dress of sea-green Padua silk, her
powdered hair is wreathed with rosebuds, and she
wears long and splendid eardrops of emerald
and topaz.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
“Boufflers caught my arm, with a smile, which
the excitement of the moment had converted into
a grimace, for he knew well enough the person for
whom I was so anxious, and knew, moreover, that
there were certain nights on which she wore the
emerald and topaz suit, and that this very night
was one of them. The veiled form continued, in
the same low voice: ‘The lady is pressing her hand
to her brow at this very instant. Is it with pain,
or is it with care? She is waiting for some one,
for now she rises and looks at the clock upon the
console, and now she goes to the small side-door
to listen.’</p>

<p>“‘Enough, enough,’ said I, in my turn, growing
impatient; ‘tell me at once what it is that ails
the lady, and what may be the remedy.’</p>

<p>“The figure spoke aloud no more, but whispered
long in Cagliostro’s ear, and the latter, turning
to me, said, with ease and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">àplomb</i>, ‘The
lady’s migraines are caused by overwatching and
anxiety—the <em>cure</em> is easy, and must be applied at
once—the <em>cause</em> will be removed in time.’</p>

<p>“He pushed back the fauteuil into the corner
whence he had drawn it; the veiled figure by
which it was occupied remained still and motionless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
as death. He then opened a small door in the
wainscot, belonging to a cupboard filled with
shelves, containing bottles of all sorts and sizes,
and drew from it a phial, which he filled from a
jug of that which stood upon the floor, and having
performed various ‘<em>passes</em>’ and evolutions over it,
he handed it to me, bidding my companion and
myself to lose no time in retiring, for others were
waiting outside.</p>

<p>“His dismissal of us was as abrupt as possible,
scarcely, indeed, consistent with politeness. ‘You
have told your ailments and your griefs—you bear
with you the never-failing cure—now begone.’</p>

<p>“With these words he opened the same low
door through which he had let out the two visitors
whom we had succeeded; and Boufflers and I
passed out, obeying, without a word, the gesture of
the magician, which pointed towards the passage
beyond.</p>

<p>“Such is the history of my first interview with
the great Cagliostro. To you, who behold daily
the strange and varied examples of magnetism, my
story will perhaps appear pale and puerile; but
you must remember that, at the time, the thing was
new, and, notwithstanding all that has been discovered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
since, none has surpassed him; even to
this very hour, the secret of Cagliostro has not
been discovered. It is supposed that ventriloquism
was much employed by him in his various <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tours
de force</i>. Perhaps it was made the agent of deception
in my own case, and the figure veiled with
black crape may have been a mere puppet set up
to delude the credulous. The circumstance which
would seem to favour greatly the suspicion of imposture
is, that, as Cagliostro never employed
twice the same agency, the <em>consultant</em> could never
come <em>prepared</em> to watch and detect the machinery
of his experiments, and in fact, being always taken
by surprise, had no leisure to think of anything
else than the consultation he had come to hold.
Again, how <em>could</em> the adept have known, by natural
means, that the Marquise de Br**, whom he had
not suffered me to name, was young and beauteous—that
she possessed eardrops of emerald and
topaz, which mixture of jewels was peculiar, and
that she would wear them on that very night? All
these reflections completely bewildered me, as I
hastened on to the Opera, certain that the marquise
would be there, full of curiosity to see if her dress
and appearance would correspond with Cagliostro’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
description. Boufflers could not help me, nor
suggest a single idea to solve the mystery, so absorbed
was he in the memory of the strange scene
he had been witnessing—so completely wonder-struck
by the silence and mystery of the whole
proceeding.</p>

<p>“We arrived at the Opera just as the curtain was
about to rise. I shall never forget the performance,
so linked is it in memory with that night’s adventure.
It was Gluck’s opera of ‘Alceste.’ Boufflers
and myself took our places in the parterre, immediately
below the loge of the marquise, which was
empty, and remained so for some time; and I can
assure you that, when, in the midst of one of the
most pathetic scenes of the opera, I heard the
door of the box open, and a valet-de-chambre announce,
as was the usage among the fashionables
of the day, ‘Madame la Marquise de Br**,’ we
both turned sharply round. She entered, muffled
up to the chin, and evidently suffering greatly from
her old enemy the migraine, for she held a screen
before her eyes to shield them from the glare of
light, and bent her head upon her hand as soon as
she had taken her seat.</p>

<p>“‘Look! she <em>has</em> roses in her hair,’ exclaimed
Boufflers, all aghast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
“It was true enough the roses were there; and
<em>I</em> could see even more, for the eardrops of emerald
and topaz caught the light of the girandole in front
of her box, and played before my eyes in a most
tantalizing manner.</p>

<p>Presently the marquise, overcome by the heat,
withdrew her cloak and muffles, and stood revealed
to us in the full light, exactly as she had been
described to us so short a time before. The dress
of sea-green Padua silk, looped with roses, seemed
completely to choke poor Boufflers, as he stood
gazing on her in mute amazement. So far, the
wizard had told us truth. Since his day, the same
experiment has been repeated, and in thousands
of instances has succeeded. You have all, I doubt
not, some little story of the kind to tell, much more
striking and interesting than mine, but the sequel
of my anecdote, I think, may be unique, so completely
did the adventure jump from the sublime
to the ridiculous at a single bound.</p>

<p>“At the conclusion of the piece we both repaired
to the box of the Marquise de Br**. She was
suffering greatly from her migraine, and greeted
me ironically, observing that I was ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bien aimable
et bien galant</i>—that she had waited for me to
escort her to the Opera, and had been compelled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
to depart from home alone. After the performance,
we all adjourned to her hotel. I had completely
reinstated myself in her good graces, by the promise
of a complete cure for her migraine. The
gentlemen of the company, however, all voted that
a glass or two of champagne should be tried first,
before the dear marquise was put to pain and
torture by any of the diabolical remedies of the
sorcerer Cagliostro. The vote was carried, and
the marquise compelled to submit to their prescription
first, which she did with the greatest
grace and good-humour, using every effort to appear
gay, although evidently suffering much pain
at the very moment.</p>

<p>I will not attempt to record all the good things
which were uttered at the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">petit souper</i>, nor all the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">idées folles</i> to which the champagne gave birth.
Boufflers was quite himself again, and had recovered
all his wonted vivacity, all his mad gaiety,
and kept us in a roar of laughter by his wicked
sallies and pointed jokes concerning our visit to
Cagliostro. He counterfeited with such excessive
humour the whole scene as it had passed before
his eyes, that no one could have imagined him
to be the same individual who had sat quaking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
in fear and awe before the very man whose
power he was now deriding in such exquisite
glee.</p>

<p>“Of course, the phial and the contents became
soon the objects of attack, and I was petitioned on
all sides for a view of them. By the permission
of the marquise herself, I yielded to the clamour,
and it was handed round amid the commentaries
of the laughing guests, until Boufflers proposed
that the remedy should at once be tried in the
presence of us all, so that, if it failed, we might at
once go and give Cagliostro the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">charivari</i> which
he would so richly deserve; and, if it succeeded,
we might publish its virtues and the compounder’s
skill throughout the world.</p>

<p>“It was not till I had uncorked the phial, and
was about to pour it into a glass, that it all at once
occurred to me, that, in the hurry of our dismissal
from the presence of Cagliostro, I had entirely
omitted to ascertain whether the liquid was to be
taken as a medicine, or to be applied externally.
To the eye, it was nothing but pure water from the
fountain, it possessed neither smell nor colour, and
the greatest curiosity was excited to behold its
marvellous effects. At length, by the suggestion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
of the marquise herself, who was growing weary of
our <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">badinage</i>, it was decided that there would be
less danger in misapplying it externally than in
swallowing it, should it prove pernicious; and as I
was chosen to be the operator, I poured a small
quantity of the water into the hollow of my hand,
which Boufflers guiding, so that not a drop was
spilt, I placed gently as possible over the forehead
of the marquise, pressing it there, but certainly not
with violence, and, supporting the back of her head
with the hand that was free, held her, thus awaiting
the result.</p>

<p>“The marquise closed her eyes, but uttered not
a word, and there was a moment’s silence among
the clamorous group bending over her with such
eager curiosity to witness the effect of the miraculous
cure, when suddenly it was broken by a loud
convulsive shriek from the marquise herself, which
was almost echoed by many of those present, so
sudden and startling did it burst from her lips.
‘Take away your hand! For God’s sake, take
away your hand!’ exclaimed she, in a voice of
agony; and, starting to her feet, she endeavoured,
with all her strength, to pull my wrist downwards.
But strange to tell, not all the efforts of the marquise,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span>
nor those I used myself, could tear away my
hand from her forehead! No words can describe
the sensation of terror with which I found myself
not only deprived of the faculty of withdrawing my
arm, but drawn by some powerful attraction closer
and closer still, until it almost seemed as if the
fingers were about to bury themselves in the flesh.</p>

<p>“At first, as you may suppose, it was imagined
by those present that the whole event was a jest,
and the piteous shrieks of the marquise, and my
own supplications for assistance, had at first been
greeted with roars of laughter; but when it was
found that the affair was serious, the company
began to take alarm. It was not, however, till the
unfortunate marquise sank back in her chair, fainting
and exhausted, that the Duc d’Argenton, recovering
from the consternation into which the
discovery of the extraordinary event had thrown
the whole assembly, seized my wrist in a nervous
grasp, and tore it by main force away, drawing
with it large patches of skin from the forehead of
the marquise, upon which the imprint of my touch
remained in bleeding characters. My hand was
torn and lacerated likewise, and the pain was unbearable.
I bound it in my handkerchief, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span>
gave all the assistance in my power towards the
recovery of Madame de Br**, who was conveyed
to bed, still in a deep swoon. We all remained in
the saloon, which had so lately been the scene of
our mad gaiety, with downcast looks and subdued
voices, waiting the report of the surgeon who had
been sent for to apply the proper remedies to
the wounds of the marquise, who was not pronounced
out of danger till towards morning. We
then dispersed, with the firm determination of
having the mystery cleared by Cagliostro himself
as soon as possible. Boufflers instantly repaired
to M. de Sartines, the head of the police, and he
furnished us with two officers, and with all power
to make search at the magician’s house, or take
any steps which we might deem necessary.</p>

<p>“Cagliostro received the visit with the greatest
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sang froid</i>, and, without the slightest resistance,
allowed the officer to prosecute his search among
the various tools and utensils which he employed
in his calling. The large jug from which he had
taken the liquid contained in the phial which he
had given to me, still stood in the same place as
on the preceding day. There remained but a few
drops, for his patients had been numerous, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
these the officer poured into a bottle and conveyed
to the nearest chemist, who laughed in the man’s
face, and pronounced them to be clear water. To
my bitter reproaches and angry exclamations,
Cagliostro replied, with perfect calmness, that the
liquid was pure and innocent when he placed it in
my hands, and that if it had grown pernicious it
must have been owing to the guilty passions or to
the evil sympathies of those who had used it. No
further explanation could be elicited, and the
affair, which made a great noise at the time, remains
a mystery to this hour. As for me, I lost
an amiable and valued friend, for the Marquise de
Br**, either through fear of the ridicule which
attached to the adventure, or from memory of the
pain which she had suffered, could never endure
me to approach her after that. She would not
even grant me an interview in order to express my
regrets at the strange accident which had happened.
She avoided me when by chance we met
in public, scarcely even returning my salutation
but by a cold and formal acknowledgment. She
refused all the efforts of our mutual friends at
effecting a reconciliation, and, wearied with my
importunities (for I really felt anxious to do away<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
the unjust impression), she ended by returning my
letters of apologies and supplications unopened.”</p>

<p>The prince paused thoughtfully. The story was
at an end.</p>

<p>“Did there remain a scar or trace of the wound
which the marquise had incurred?” said Madame
de V——.</p>

<p>“She carried the mark of that night’s adventure
to her grave,” replied the prince; “a long, narrow
scar, which all the art of the coiffeur could not disguise.
The corner of one her exquisitely traced
eyebrows, too, had been torn off, and never grew
again; but she replaced it with great effect by an
<em>assassin</em>, which she wore there ever after.”</p>

<p>The prince paused again for a moment, and then
added, while a smile full of malicious glee, of exquisite
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">finesse</i>, passed across his countenance,
“The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">girandole</i> eardrops of emerald and topaz
she not only wore no more, but had the cruelty to
bestow upon her maid, who adorned herself with
them at the next Opera ball, whither she was sent
by her mistress to <em>intriguer</em> me, while the lovely
marquise replaced them at times with long pendants
of snowy pearl, emblem of innocence and
simplicity, and I soon began to observe, with bitterness,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>
that, on these occasions, whether I proposed
Opera, ball, or play, Boufflers always had some
‘particular engagement’ which prevented him from
joining our party.”</p>

<p>Many were the comments upon this adventure,
and many the discussions upon the possible contents
of the phial, which it would be absurd to suppose
consisted of nought but pure water. Some
defended Cagliostro, others were loud against him,
when the dear Duchess de V——, fearing that the
time might be lost in dissertations on mesmerism,
suddenly exclaimed, “Dear prince, you who have
seen so many great men in your time, did you ever
see Voltaire?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, fair lady, I <em>did</em> once behold
M. de Voltaire,” (the prince always called him so
to the last day of his life,) “and my interview with
him is connected in my mind with a curious fact.
The narrative of my adventure may perhaps amuse
you. It was in 1778, the year before his death,
that I had the singular good fortune to obtain an
audience of the great philosopher. He lived at
the corner of the Rue de Beaune and the quai
which has since been called by his name. He had
intimated to my friend, Champfort, his great desire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span>
to become acquainted with me, and I, who all my
life had been tormented with the wish to behold
this greatest genius of the age, the master spirit of
his own time, the guide of that which was to follow,
did not need a second bidding.</p>

<p>“The philosopher received us with great urbanity.
He had been prepared for our visit in the
morning, for he still loved dearly all kinds of form
and ceremony, and, to the very last day of his life,
set a higher price upon his title of M. <em>de</em> Voltaire
(which, by the by, was usurped) than on the popular
and honourable abbreviation of ‘Voltaire,’
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tout court</i>, by which he was designated long before
his death. M. de Voltaire was seated on the edge
of his bed, attired in one of those short loose dressing-gowns
much worn at the time, and which displayed
his spindle legs and shrunken feet in all
their unveiled ugliness. Never have I beheld a
form so withered, so diminished; every vein in his
whole frame was visible and defined, like those in
an anatomical study. The later portraits of M.
de Voltaire give a very just idea of his appearance,
but they generally fail in expressing the singular
look of the eyes—an expression which I
never have seen in any one since that time—an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
anxious, unquiet, restless look—a hungry, thirsty,
keenly-searching glance (hunger and thirst of
praise), and searching with avidity for admiration,
which, such was the Voltairian fever of the time, he
never failed to obtain, and yet, as ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">l’appétit vient
en mangeant</i>,’ never wholly satisfied his craving.</p>

<p>“The room wherein the great man received his
visitors was entirely darkened (such was his whim),
save where one single shutter, folded back, allowed
the light to stream in through a long, narrow aperture,
immediately opposite to which he himself was
placed, so that he became thus the sole object
clearly visible in the apartment. And here he sat
to receive visitors, although, the sun shining at the
moment, the light was so strong that it must almost
have blinded him. His niece, Madame Denis,
‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">belle et bonne</i>,’ was seated at the foot of the bed
near the chimney, attired in a dimity camisole,
rather soiled, and her hair, escaping in disorder
from the little cap placed on the top of her head,
was tied in a fantastical <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fontange</i> with a faded blue
ribbon. She was no longer young, poor <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">belle et
bonne</i>, and her sedentary life had induced a degree
of corpulence which made her look older still. She
had certainly forfeited all pretensions to her first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
title, and there was much in her face that to a physiognomist
would have given a flat contradiction to
the second. She had evidently been engaged in
writing from M. de Voltaire’s dictation, for she had
risen from the bureau, and turned to the fire, where
there was placed some cooking utensil to which
she soon directed her attention.</p>

<p>“But it was not long before I had forgotten the
very existence of Madame Denis, in the interest of
the conversation with M. de Voltaire himself. He
spoke quickly and nervously, with a play of feature
I have never seen in any man except him. His
eye kindled with a vivid fire almost dazzling, as it
danced in the ray of sunlight from the window, and
moved about from one to the other of his listeners,
rapid and quivering like the summer lightning.
He had just been receiving, that very morning, a
deputation from the Théâtre Français, begging
permission to commence the performance of ‘Zaïre’
that evening with a complimentary address to himself,
which permission of course the poet had
granted with an enviable self-satisfaction, merely
requesting that the verses should be submitted to
his own inspection, and subjected to his own corrections
and improvements, if any such were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
needed. He was in high good humour at this
mark of honour and distinction, for, as I have said
before, flattery had become of more importance to
his existence than the very food and nourishment of
each day.</p>

<p>“When the great man had conversed for some
little time with my friend, with whom he had been
intimate for many years, he turned to me, and, after
courteously expressing the pleasure which my visit
gave him, he added, ‘I had desired to see you,
M. de Perigord, to communicate to you a fact concerning
your family, which happened some years
ago, and may be of importance to you hereafter.
As you are the youngest of your family, you may
one day like to be its chronicler.’</p>

<p>“He then commenced the relation of some interesting
particulars regarding the Talleyrands and
Perigords, intermixing, with a precision of memory
quite marvellous, the different branches and connexions
either by birth or marriage. All these, of
course, were familiar to me, but, as it was not
natural that a narrator like M. de Voltaire should
ever tell a story without a point, all this preamble
ended in a tale of interest and wonder which completely
riveted my whole attention, and kept me in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>
a thrill of delight, not so much by the story itself,
which, however, was full of most powerful interest,
as by the irresistible charm of the diction. I can
safely affirm that M. de Voltaire spoke with even
more ease and grace than distinguish his writings.
I think he would have made a splendid orator.
His words seemed to <em>fly</em> from his lips, so rapid, yet
so neat, so distinct and clear was every expression.
His meaning was so precisely defined, that you
never had an instant’s doubt or hesitation whether
you were quite sure that you fully understood him.
The language of Champfort, bold and vigorous as
it was—full of fire and passion—seemed to lack
energy and spirit as he answered M. de Voltaire.
The fire of the one was like the red beacon light,
steady and strong, lurid and fierce; the other was
the treacherous spark which, flying upwards in
seemingly harmless sport, yet driven this way or
that by the most trifling breeze, may spread ruin
and devastation wherever it may chance to fall.</p>

<p>“We remained for more than an hour with the
great philosopher. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Belle et bonne</i> had completed
the cooking of her chocolate, and M. de Voltaire
had taken it, without the slightest ceremony, in our
presence. Letters had arrived, to some few of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
which he had dictated short replies through the
medium of his niece. I had listened in rapture to
the story which I had come to hear; Champfort had
already been twice confuted in argument, and M.
de Voltaire obliged once to yield, before we arose
to depart, and even then I think we were hurried
away by Madame Denis, who reminded her uncle,
with a look full of meaning at us, that it was just
the hour for his siesta; which clear, unmistakable
hint, of course, we immediately took, and left him
to enjoy his repose unmolested. I looked at him
long and earnestly as he shook me cordially by the
hand, and bade me a most paternal farewell.
Every line of that remarkable countenance is engraven
on my memory. I see it now before me—the
small fiery eyes staring from the shrunken
sockets, not unlike those of a cameleon; the dried
and withered cheek traversed in every direction by
deep cut lines; the compressed lips and puckered
mouth, round which played a perpetual, sarcastic
smile, giving him altogether the air of a merry fiend.
Every feature of that face is as present to my
memory now as it was at that moment while I was
gazing on it, impressed with a kind of sorrowful
conviction that I should behold it no more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
“The event proved that I was right in my presentiment:
M. de Voltaire, soon after that, denied
himself entirely to strangers, and none but his intimate
friends were admitted. These, however, were
sufficiently numerous to form a little court around
him, and to do him all the honour which he so
much loved, and amid which he died, surrounded
by flatterers and sycophants until the latest hour of
his life.”</p>

<p>“Now, if it is not an indiscretion, do tell us the
story that he told you, prince,” exclaimed the
Princess de C——, as Prince Talleyrand concluded
his recital; “do tell us the tale that Voltaire could
think worthy a place in his memory: it must be a
curious one. Try and recount it in the same manner
that he used when telling it to you. I am sure
you would imitate it admirably.”</p>

<p>The prince smiled, (he never laughed,) as he
replied, “Now have I to make a strange confession,
for which I know you will never pardon me,
and which I would willingly have been spared.
Indeed, had it not happened to myself, I could
scarcely have credited it. On leaving Voltaire,
Champfort and myself had separated; he had taken
the direction of the Tuileries, and I had sauntered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
along to the Palais Royal, thinking all the while of
the great man to whose presence I had just been
admitted, and retracing in memory every word,
every gesture, he had used during the interview.
In the garden I was accosted by the young Duc
d’Aiguillon, who had just arrived from Versailles,
and who began in his usual rattling manner telling
me a long story about the ball which had taken
place the evening before in the Orangerie, of which
story, mark you, I remember every word. It was
about the Duchesse de Levis, a sort of court butt
just at that time, and the changing of her shoulder-knot
by some wag, which <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">plaisanterie</i> had caused
the most laughable mistakes during the whole ball.</p>

<p>“When I had got rid of this wild talker, I adjourned
to the hotel of the Marquise de J——,
where there was <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">grande reception</i>, followed by
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">grand jeu</i> and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">souper</i>. There I remained until a
late hour of the night, alternately winning and losing
considerable sums at the faro table, until I rose
winner of a hundred and twenty louis d’or from
Maurice Duvernay, of which he paid me seventy
down, but having lost immensely, wrote an order
for the rest on the back of one of the Queens of
Diamonds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>
“I tell you all this to show you that I can, to
this very hour, account for every minute of that
day, one of the most memorable of my whole life,
from the moment of my leaving M. de Voltaire;
and when I returned home, late as was the hour,
before retiring to rest, I sat down to begin a letter
to my uncle, the Cardinal de Perigord, in order to
recount to him the adventure of the morning, and
above all, to tell him the anecdote concerning our
family, which M. de Voltaire had related, and in
which I knew my uncle would take a most peculiar
delight, both from the source whence it came, and
the personal interest inspired by the subject. Judge,
then, of the mortification I experienced upon finding
that, in spite of all my endeavours to collect
my wandering ideas to the one point in question, I
could not recollect the story which M. de Voltaire
had been at so much pains to tell me, to which I
had listened with so much attention and with such
extraordinary relish; I could not even write in my
letter the immediate object of the story—neither
detail, nor hero, nor point, (which last I remembered
had diverted me beyond measure,) would present
itself to my remembrance; and, after much vexation
of spirit, I was fain to leave my letter unfinished,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
until I had met with Champfort, whose
memory I doubted not would be fully able to supply
the deficiency of mine.</p>

<p>“I was determined to lose no time in assuring
myself of this, and called upon the poet the very
next day. What, think you, was his answer to my
urgent entreaties that he would assist me? ‘Parbleu,
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon cher</i>, I was too much occupied in thinking
what I should say to M. de Voltaire to notice
what <em>he</em> was saying to me. I heard not a word of
his story, but you must own that I completely succeeded
in proving the false quantity in the second
canto of the Henriade.’</p>

<p>“He had not even heard the story! so there
was no hope in that quarter, and I was obliged to
content myself with the trust, that at some future
day I might be fortunate enough again to meet
M. de Voltaire, and induce him to tell the tale
once more. As I have already said, however, I
had not the good fortune to see him afterwards.</p>

<p>“Often and often, in the long years that have
passed since then, have I endeavoured to catch the
purport of his tale, but in vain. The whole scene of
that interview rises at command—the welcome,
the farewell, and the various arguments of the two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">beaux-esprits</i>—but that narrative, which I would
often give much to remember, is gone for ever!
The pre-occupation of the scene, the wonder, the
delight inspired by the philosopher’s conversation,
have left a blank, which neither time nor reflection
have ever been able to fill up; and even now I
cannot remember the incident without feeling the
same kind of embarrassment which I experienced
on that occasion, and often surprise myself when,
falling into reverie, chasing the phantoms of that
hour through my puzzled brain, and endeavouring,
in spite of experience, to arrest the fugitive impressions
made by the story at the time, but without
success.”</p>

<p>The prince now paused, and leant back in his
chair for a moment, with his eyes closed, evidently
lost in thought. It was well that no one spoke, or
we might have been deprived of the tale which
followed, and in which, at the age I was then, I
took more interest, and remembered with more
pleasure, than any which had preceded it.</p>

<p>“How mysterious a thing is memory,” said he,
as he bent forward once more, and smiled upon
his listeners. “The name of Champfort has
brought to my mind the story, long-forgotten, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
his fellow-prisoner, a young officer formerly in the
mousquetaires. His name we all know, for he is
among us still, and, in short, he has promised that
he will visit us, before the autumn is over, here at
Valençay. He was, without exception, the handsomest
youth I have ever seen; and his manners
and address being remarkable for a grace peculiarly
his own, and his reputation for high courage and
chivalrous bearing having been fully established
by one or two <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">affaires brillantes</i> in which he had
been engaged, it may naturally be supposed that
his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">succès</i> of every kind left him nothing to desire.
But he sought no conquest, even where the enemy
held out offers of surrender; he seemed callous
and indifferent to all the advances, the allurements,
of which he was the object, until, such was the
state of morals at that time, the ladies of the great
world in which he moved began to act as spies
upon each other, being fully convinced of the impossibility
of his having remained so long insensible
to the arts and blandishments by which
he was surrounded.</p>

<p>“For a long time his secret remained impenetrable;
his part was so well acted, his measures
so well taken, that the scandal-mongers were in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
despair, and the charitable souls, of whom there
are always a few, were beginning to hope, when the
mystery was divulged in a most extraordinary
manner, and formed the town talk for many a day;
and, as the story has been told with divers variations,
and has got abroad under different versions,
I will tell you the right one, which I had from the
Marquis de J——’s own lips:</p>

<p>“In those days there were <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fermiers généraux</i>,
and the said <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fermiers généraux</i> were almost
always among the oldest, ugliest, richest, and most
disagreeable men that the kingdom could produce.
One of these, who united in himself all these
superlatives, had just deceived all the cherished
hopes of the ladies of the court by marrying a
young girl from his own province, of noble birth,
although of slender fortune, who was described as
being of little beauty, and glad to acquire by
marriage, wealth and station, even at the sacrifice
of those other qualities in a husband which are
generally sought for by young ladies.</p>

<p>“A year had elapsed since the return of M. de B.
from Besançon, where the marriage had taken place.
No one had seen his bride; she remained entirety
at his country house—a delicious little ‘Folie,’ so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>
it was said, at Auteuil, close to the Bois de
Boulogne. The lady had not been presented at
court, and M. de B. had never requested any of
his friends to visit her, so that she was at first supposed
to be imbecile or ugly, and was then forgotten.
But the devil’s hoof, which certainly is
busy with all men’s concerns, trotted one day
through the muddled brain of the old Dowager de
Marville, and suggested to her that it would be a
mighty pleasant thing to have a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">feu d’artifice</i> in
the Bois de Bologne, on some dark night when
there would be no moon, and that it would be
quite a funny sight to behold all the skirts of the
wood festooned with coloured lamps, and adorned
with flambeaux; and then she began to torment
M. de B. to throw open his ‘Folie’ to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">élite</i>, and
give a fête there to his friends without delay. He
was a good-natured man, but, nevertheless, he
took a great deal of persuading before he would
consent to have his privacy thus broken in upon.
He offered the ladies of his acquaintance a ball at
his own hôtel in Paris, with interludes of opera-dancers.
But no, the fête at the ‘Folie’—nothing
else would do, and the poor man was obliged at
last to promise the much-desired entertainment.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
His excuses had all a relation to his wife; her
ignorance of the world, her innocence and utter
simplicity, had all been put forward as motives for
refusing, but no excuse could be taken. Give the
fête he must, and the ladies, on their part, promised
to treat the rustic bride with indulgence, and not
to crush her by too great an assumption of superiority.</p>

<p>“The day of the fête arrived. The most
brilliant anticipations had been formed of the entertainment
to be given in such a sweet place, by so
rich a man, and they were most certainly not
disappointed. Every arrangement was of the best,
and the whole place illuminated like a dream of
fairy-land; which last circumstance did not vex
the ladies so much as one would have imagined,
for it helped to prove that the opinions which had
been formed of the bride of M. de B. were correct
in all points. She was very young, very timid,
and very reserved and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">gauche</i>, like a little <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pensionnaire
de couvent</i> as she was; and, what was worse,
like all <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">provinciales</i>, who think nothing more
beautiful than what is to be found in their own
province, she never once expressed the slightest
admiration or astonishment at anything she saw—nay,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
she preserved the same cold, unmoved air,
even when her husband presented to her, in due
form, the vanquisher of all hearts, the renowned
Marquis de J——! Some of the ladies said that she
was pretty; some said not; some that she might
become dangerous in time, from her paleness and
the languishing expression of her eyes. Others
again laughed at this opinion, and felt sure that
there would never be anything to dread from her.
These last expressed surprise that she had even
made the conquest of her stupid old husband.</p>

<p>“Well, the company left the ‘Folie,’ enchanted
with their entertainment, and dispersed at daybreak
to their respective hotels, without so much as bestowing
a thought either on Madame de B. or her
husband. The next day, however, loud was the
wailing among the ladies, for the Marquis de J——
was missing from all his accustomed haunts, where
he had been used daily to charm the eyes and
captivate the hearts of his fair admirers. Kind
and anxious messages were despatched to his
quarters, and the answer given was, that the marquis
was slightly indisposed, but would appear
again in a day or two. The next rumour afloat
was, that old B., the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fermier-général</i>, had sent back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>
his wife to the convent from which he had taken
her the year before to marry her; but no one felt
astonishment at this—so cold, so awkward, so shy—not
even polite to the Marquis de J——! Of
course, poor old B. must feel assured he never
could get on in the world with such a wife as
that.</p>

<p>“The marquis appeared again in a few days after
the fête, but much altered in appearance, with
haggard, melancholy look, and sad, dejected spirits.
His arm was in a sling, too, which gave rise to
more tender questioning, which he sought to parry
as well as he was able, by saying that he had met
with an accident at M. de B——’s Folie.</p>

<p>“The history of the case was this. (Oh, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">jeune</i>
France, know you what even the meaning of the
word ‘love’ is?) After the company had departed,
M. and Madame de B—— had retired to their respective
apartments, but M. de B——, being unable
to sleep, had descended into the garden, to
take a refreshing walk amid the groves, where still
hung suspended the variegated <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">lampions</i>, extinguished,
drowning with their vile odour the scent
of the flowers. There was no moon, but the night
was wearing away, and the dawn was just beginning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>
to change the pitchy darkness to a pale tint
of grey, when M. de B—— thought of retiring towards
the house. Just as he was in the act of
mounting the steps which led to the long glass
windows of his own room, his attention was attracted
by the sound of footsteps on the gravel
walk beneath. He was by no means a coward,
M. de B——, and his first thought was of his wife,
and of the alarm which a hue and cry raised at
such an hour might occasion her; so after calling
‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Qui vive?</i>’ and receiving no answer, he slid gently
down over the balustrade of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">perron</i> into the
flower-garden below, feeling quite sure of the capture
of the thief, as the little plot of ground belonging
to his wife’s apartment had no communication
with the park, save by a door of which she herself
always kept the key. He ran lightly over the
grass and along the gravel-walk; he could hear retreating
footsteps; as he advanced he was sure of
this, but the bushes overhung the narrow pathway
in such luxuriance, that he could not discern the
form which he was pursuing. At length he reached
the bottom of the path—he distinctly heard the
swinging of the gate as it was opened cautiously—he
made one frantic bound across the flower-bed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span>
which skirted the path—the door <em>must</em> have been
opened by some one, for it banged-to just as he
approached—he heard a faint cry on the outer
side, and then all was silent as the grave. M. de
B—— could proceed no farther, for the key was
not in the lock, and the door was closed, but he
immediately sought the apartment of his wife, full
of alarm concerning her, and dreading lest some
thief, lured by the display of jewels which she had
worn on the previous evening, might have endeavoured
to force an entry through the ill-secured
glass-windows of the chamber, which looked into
the garden. To his utter astonishment, after having
with difficulty regained his own room, and
thence by the inner passages of the house arrived
at the chamber of his wife, he found her up and
dressed, still decked with the same jewels which
she had worn at the fête. She evinced great alarm
and trepidation at first, on hearing his recital, but,
after a moment’s reflection, declared her belief that
M. de B—— must have been under the influence
of a dream, as she had herself been standing at the
window taking the air, and had heard no sound
nor beheld any shadow pass. He asked for the
key of the gate: she had mislaid it, she said, and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
the gate being so seldom used, she had not cared
to search for it. So M. de B—— was fain to
content himself with this assurance until daybreak,
when he was determined to renew his search
more minutely. The garden was torn and trampled
towards the direction of the gate, but that might be
by his own footsteps, for he had hurried in his
pursuit after the flying thief. The gate was closed
and locked, and yet there was still some mystery
in the adventure, for, on the outer side, which
opened into the park, the ground was stained by
drops of blood, which could be traced to some
little distance, and then ceased altogether. Here
was more mystery still, for the gardener, on searching
amid the bushes, found the key of the gate,
which had so long been missing. M. de B——
instantly applied it to the lock, and the door
yielded slowly and with difficulty to his endeavours
to push it forward, and when at length it opened,
and the obstacle was sought for, it was found
to be a <em>human finger</em>, crushed and jammed
against the doorpost, which, upon a close inspection,
appeared to have been cut off close to the
root by some rude and hurried operation.</p>

<p>“Alas! Madame de B——, who had remained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
calm and passive during the whole of this adventure,
could not support this last disclosure, but
was seized with violent hysterics upon being informed
of the discovery which had taken place,
and in the midst of her tears and convulsions, the
name of the Marquis de J—— was for ever on her
lips. Of course the adventure could no longer be
kept secret; the coincidence of the wound, the utterance
of the name of M. de J——, determined
at once the nature of the occurrence. He himself
described to me the terror of his flight through the
flower-garden, the agony of fear with which he
hurried forth lest <em>she</em> should be discovered. It
was M. de B——, who, in pushing against the
door, had jammed his finger in the lock, but he
cared not for the pain so long as <em>she</em> was safe and
secure from all suspicion, and, disdaining to call
for help, he had himself drawn forth the little
pocket-knife which he always carried, and cut off
the finger by which he was detained. He had
never once thought of the danger or disfigurement;
he did it, not complaining, but rejoicing to think
that <em>she</em> was unsuspected at least, and her reputation
secure. His only regret was at having lost
the key of the gate, which he had dropped among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
the bushes, when he had stopped to bandage with
his pocket-handkerchief the bleeding wound. Had
<em>she</em> not betrayed herself in her grief for him, their
secret might yet have been kept. M. de J——
left Paris soon after, and travelled for some years,
and Madame de B—— was despatched back again
to the convent at Besançon, from which she had
not been absent more than a twelvemonth in all.
It is said that M. de J—— remained for ever faithful
to his first love. It is certain that when he returned
among us, handsome, brilliant as before,
although less gay, he never sought to inspire
affection in any of the fair ladies who were at so
much pains to please him. He steadily refused
all offers of marriage which were made him, although
some of the most splendid <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">partis</i>, both
maids and widows, were among the number. From
the first moment of his beholding Madame de
B——, which was on her arrival with her husband,
while changing horses at the last relay towards
Paris, at the post-house, where he happened to be
halting with his troop—he had owned himself her
slave; he vowed to me for years afterwards, that
no other woman should ever boast of having won
a thought from him, and that no other female<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
hand should ever feel the pressure of his own.
His heart was with her who was suffering loneliness
and captivity for his sake, and he regarded
as sacrilege the idea of a possibility that he could
break his vow of fidelity to her. At the revolution,
he was imprisoned, but released <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">faute de preuves</i>,
and, meanwhile, the convents having been broken
up and dispersed, his first step was to secure a
safe retreat for Madame de B——. Together they
fled to Holland, where they remained for some
years, and returned, when the storm was over, as
man and wife. They lived together in happiness,
and we all can bear witness to the grace and distinction
which she shed around the circle she frequented,
and to the respect with which she inspired
all who approached her, as well as to the regret
which was universally felt when she was withdrawn
from us for ever. Such is the true story of the
Marquis de J——: now tell me, Jeune France,
will ye dare to condemn the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ancien régime</i>, or say
that you even understand the depth of devotion and
of love from which such faith as this could spring?”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The prince rose as he concluded his story, and
the grating of carriage-wheels on the gravel walk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>
without the windows, announced the hour for the
promenade. I took my seat in one of the landaus
by the side of C., who had promised to show me
the lions of the place, but it was some time before
I could command my attention to the beauties of
the scene, for the story of the prince had brought
back the memory of my last <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">soirée</i> in Paris, where
I had beheld a withered old man playing with
avidity at <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bouillotte</i>, and I remembered to have
been startled and disgusted when he took up his
cards in a <em>three-fingered</em> grasp. And now I remembered,
too, that his partner had addressed him
by the name of De J——.</p>

<span class="subhead">CHILDHOOD AND JUVENILE YEARS OF TALLEYRAND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Our drive was delightful over the green turf beneath
the arched vista of the old avenue. The
rain-drops glittered on every leaf, and the turf,
moistened by the shower, after the long drought,
sent up a delicious fragrance beneath each pressure
of our horses’ feet. The prince was alone in his
carriage, with his dog Carlo. There was but one
person in the whole world whom he ever allowed
to take the seat beside him in his drives, and she
was that day absent from Valençay. There was
something touching and poetical in the solitary
figure as he reclined back, leaning on his cane,
not gazing on the landscape, but musing, abstracted
and motionless, save that from time to
time he would bend slightly forward, and pat old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
Carlo fondly on the neck, as if his train of thought
had led him into recollections of the long attachment
of the faithful animal, contrasting it, perhaps,
with the treachery and ingratitude which he had
met with in man.</p>

<p>In the poetic fervour of the moment I could not
help hazarding this supposition to my friend, who
laughed heartily at my youthful enthusiasm, but
declared that it was never so ill-bestowed, for that
it had been subject of astonishment that the Prince
was never known to give way, after the fashion of
age, to any of those loud and bitter railings against
the injustice and ingratitude of mankind, which
sometimes render the society of elderly persons
liable to the complaint of querulousness and discontent,
and yet none had ever perhaps better
cause of complaint than he has had.</p>

<p>“The destiny of that man,” said C., musingly,
and scarcely conscious that he was speaking aloud,
“has been a most singular and mysterious one.
Each great event of his life might serve as a type
of the people among whom it took place, and illustrative
of the times in which it <em>could</em> have happened.
The history of his childhood alone would
serve to paint the epoch. It was one of the latest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
examples of a style of morals and manners which
the great revolution wholly swept away. He was
born in Paris, in the year 1754. As was usual
with families of distinction at that period, a nurse
had been provided, who lodged in the hotel for
some time previously to the birth of the expected
babe, so that, immediately on the arrival of the
offensive object, she might be at hand to carry it
away. This arrangement was most agreeable and
convenient. In a little space the mother re-appeared,
brilliant and gay as ever, amid the circles
she had deserted but for a moment. She had to
endure at first, on the part of her ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">essaim d’adorateurs</i>,’
some few tender reproaches upon her
cruelty in having deprived her friends of the charm
of her society ‘for so many centuries,’ some few
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">grivois</i> remarks upon the <em>accident</em> which had
caused this absence, and then the event was forgotten
by all, even by the lady herself, who resumed,
with increased ardour, her gambling and
flirtations, while the poor wretched infant, abandoned
by its natural protectors, and condemned to
the care of mercenaries, was left either to vegetate
in ignorance and filth, or to die without even having
known a single moment of its mother’s love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
“Such was the fate of Charles Maurice, the
eldest son of the Comte de Talleyrand. Hurried
from the paternal home in the very hour of his
birth, he was taken into a distant part of the country
by a nurse whose trade it was to tend and
bring up children <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tant bien que mal</i>, as he himself
has often said. Here he remained until he had
arrived at the age of seven years. The nurse was
regularly paid—her reports of the child were
always good—he was her ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cher coco</i>’—‘the darling
of her heart,’ ‘the pride of the whole country.’
He was well in health—he had fresh air and exercise—he
wanted neither food nor clothing—what
then could the boy require more than all these?
His mother must have answered this question, if
ever she put it to herself, most satisfactorily; for it
is certain she continued the business of her life—the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">petit jeu</i>, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">grand jeu</i>, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">petit lever</i>, the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">grand lever</i>—with as much energy and ardour as
if no child had ever been. About this time, however,
another ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fâcheux accident</i>’ occurred—the
birth of another son. Again was the lady obliged
to retire for a while; again were her sentimental
swains in deep distress. The second son appeared,
and, like the first, was full of health and vigour;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
like the eldest, cast in the mould of a manly race,
with neither spot nor blemish. Such had been the
will of God—but how was his goodly work perverted!</p>

<p>“The poor little new-comer was, like Charles
Maurice, despatched to the same village where <em>he</em>
still dwelt—revelling in village ignorance and
liberty, with no care and no constraint, knowing
no master, for he was the young seigneur; fearing
no God, for he himself was the idol of the whole
canton. None of his own family had been to see
him during the whole of those weary years, and the
little brother, whose arrival he now welcomed with
such glee, in consideration of sundry boxes of delicious
bon-bons, with which the nurse, according
to old French custom, returned laden, was the only
individual, not only of his race, but also of his
own rank and station, whom he had ever seen!
The father was frequently absent with the army
for whole years together, in the pursuit of fame;
the mother was entirely absorbed in the duties of
the court, and stirred not further from Paris than
Versailles. <em>She</em> was steady in pursuit of fortune.
Did either of them succeed? The one died young,
obscure in the annals of his house; the other died<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
old and dependent; while the poor neglected child
lived to make all Europe ring with his renown;
and to found, by his own exertions, one of the most
splendid fortunes of the Continent! Thus will
Fortune mock at the weak endeavours of poor vain
mortals, to work out their own destiny!</p>

<p>“Such was the tender care and nursing that befel
Charles Maurice, the eldest son of the Comte de
Talleyrand Perigord, and the circumstances of his
childhood, so far from being remarkable or uncommon,
may be taken as an example of the manner
in which the nobles of that day fulfilled the
first and most solemn duty of the whole existence
of man—that of tending and fostering with care
the offspring which God has been pleased to bestow.
However, all evil, as well as good, must cease
in time, and Providence has granted for our consolation
that, as the one must have an end, so shall
the other not endure for ever; and thus, about
three years after the arrival in the village of the
little Archambault, his brother Charles Maurice
did at length behold the countenance of one of
his own kith and kin. The youngest brother of
his father, the Bailli de Talleyrand, capitaine des
galères, and knight of Malta, had just returned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>
from a cruise. He had been absent from his
family for many years, and came with a heart overflowing
with love towards his whole kindred;
among whom stood first his brother and his young
children.</p>

<p>“He was much grieved at the absence of the
children, and immediately declared his intention
of proceeding to the village where they had been
placed, in order to embrace them before he set
sail again, perhaps never to return. It was the
depth of winter—the snow lay heavy on the ground—the
roads were dangerous, but, ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corbleu! morbleu!
ventrebleu!</i>’ what cared he for danger? and
what danger should prevent him from visiting the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">petits drôles</i>, and even from carrying the eldest off
to serve with him on board the Saint Joseph, if he
found him, as he doubted not he should, full of
fire and courage, and willing to assist in rebuilding
the fortunes of his family by serving on the seas?
He arrived at the village near nightfall, and alone,
for the roads were so bad that he had been obliged
to take horse; and, but one having been found in
a serviceable condition, his servant had been
obliged to stay at the town some miles distant.</p>

<p>“The entrance of the brave bailli into that solitary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
village must have caused quite a sensation;
and I have heard that the whole scene has remained
graven on the powerful memory of the
prince, as though it had occurred but yesterday.
He will sometimes recount it to his intimates, and
laugh at the singularity of the circumstances; but
that laugh, believe me, must be one of bitterness
and scorn. No wonder that this man should have
felt such strange contempt for his fellow man—no
wonder that he should at times have acted as
though he fancied that he alone existed in the
world.</p>

<p>“Well, just at a turn of the road which led
down into the village, the bailli bethought himself
that he knew not the way to the house of the
Mère Rigaut, the nurse to whom he had been
directed; and he checked his steed, to gaze around
and see if any one was in view who could assist
him. While he thus paused, there came hobbling
up the hill a pale, delicate-looking boy, with long
ringlets of very fair hair, hanging loose over
his shoulders, and an indescribable look of gentility,
which the bailli perceived at once—at least
he always said so afterwards. He carried a bird-trap
in his hand, for he was just going out to seek<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
for larks among the snow. The bailli called to
him to come on faster; but, alas! as he drew near,
he perceived that he was very lame, and that he
bore a little crutch, which, however, he did not
always use, but sometimes walking several steps
without its aid, would flourish it before him as if in
defiance, until a roughness in the road, or a loose
stone, compelled him to place it again beneath his
arm.</p>

<p>“‘Hallo, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon garçon</i>!’ shouted the bailli, ‘will
you tell me the way to the house of the Mère
Rigaut?’</p>

<p>“‘That I will,’ cried the boy, eyeing the bailli
askance and smiling slyly; ‘and, moreover, I will
conduct you thither, if you will give me——’</p>

<p>“‘Ay, ay,’ said the bailli, ‘never fear; but make
haste child—the wind blows cold and sharp, and
you shall have no cause to complain of my want of
generosity.’</p>

<p>“‘Nay, nay,’ replied the boy, colouring, ‘I
meant to have asked you but for a ride on your
steed to Mother Rigaut’s door.’</p>

<p>“And as the child spoke, he looked with envy
at the rough post-horse, which, all unkempt and
shaggy as he was, appeared far superior to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span>
rude animals employed in plough or cart—the
only ones ever seen in that distant village.</p>

<p>“‘Is that all?’ said the good-natured bailli, ‘then
come along—mount—quick, my lad—there—jump
up in the twinkling of an eye.’</p>

<p>“The boy, lame as he was, sprang into the
saddle, but the portly person of the bailli prevented
him from taking a safe seat, so he leaned his little
crutch upon the toe of the bailli’s boot, and
grappled the horse’s mane with a firm grasp, almost
standing upright; while the bailli, heedless of his
perilous situation, trotted over the rough stones of
the village pavement, the bells at the horse’s
bridle jingling merrily, and the loud laugh—half
fear, half delight—of the bold urchin echoing far
and near. Of course the whole village was roused
in an instant, and the astonishment was great at
beholding Mother Rigaut’s ‘Charlot’ trotting down
the street upon a strange gentleman’s steed, his
long fair hair blown about by the wind, and his
face shining and glowing amid the golden masses
of silken curls which fell over it.</p>

<p>“The bailli stopped at Mother Rigaut’s door, but
so little was he prepared to meet the truth, that he
bade the boy, with whom he seemed mightily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span>
pleased, hold the horse while he entered the house
to speak to the good woman, who was already
standing on the threshold, all smiles and courtesies,
to welcome the strange gentleman. The bailli
entered and closed the door after him. What passed
within none can tell. It must have been an extraordinary
scene, for the sound of voices in high
dispute was heard for some minutes—a sound of
sobbing and of wailing, and of loud expostulation;
and presently the bailli was seen bursting from the
cottage, and rushing upon the boy, and hugging
and embracing him with transports of affection;
then, all pale and trembling with emotion, he waved
back with his riding-whip the advances of Mère
Rigaut, who was pressing forward to clasp the child
in her arms, and, seizing him in a sturdy grasp, he
threw him on the saddle, and sprang up after him.
But this time he allowed him room enough to ride
at ease, and bade him sit in comfort, and then he
placed his brawny arm round the boy’s middle
with solicitude, to keep him firm upon the saddle,
and, putting spurs to the capering post-horse, he
dashed out of the village without even asking news
of any other child, or suffering the boy to take a
last farewell of the Mère Rigaut, who followed him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
with shrieks and lamentations until he was lost to
sight.</p>

<p>“It was not till they had arrived at the little
town, distant about two leagues from the village
wherein Charles Maurice de Talleyrand—Mother
Rigaut’s ‘Charlot’—had passed these first twelve
years of his eventful life, and which he was destined
to behold no more—that he was informed
that the strange gentleman who had carried him
off so abruptly, and in such a storm of indignation
that he had not even stayed to see the little
Archambaut, was his own uncle, the Bailli de
Talleyrand, his father’s brave and loving brother,
whose generous heart had glowed with such indignation
at sight of the unheeded state in which the
poor child had been left, crippled for life through
the awkwardness of the ignorant nurse, that, without
hesitation, without permission, he had torn him from
his misery, and, although greatly disappointed in the
hope he had conceived of being able to take him on
board the ship he commanded, in consequence of his
infirmity, yet he would not suffer him to remain a
moment longer abandoned to the ignorant kindness
of which he had so long been a victim.</p>

<p>“As he was compelled to delay his return to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
Paris for some little time, he immediately wrote to
the count, to inform him of the circumstances in
which he had found his nephew, Charles Maurice,
and his intention of bringing him at once to Paris.
The letter reached its destination some days before
the worthy bailli, accompanied by his young charge,
drove into the courtyard of the hotel where the
Comte de Talleyrand resided. Here, to his great
mortification, he found that the count was absent
with the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">armée de Flandre</i>; the countess was also
absent on duty at the palace, it being her <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">semaine
de service</i>, and not for worlds would she neglect her
duty. She had, however, with an affectionate <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">prévoyance</i>,
worthy of the greatest praise, appointed a
gentleman to receive the boy from the hands of the
bailli—a professor, who was to be his tutor at the
College Louis le Grand, whither he was immediately
to conduct his pupil, arrangements having
already been made for his reception. The bailli
sighed as he consigned the lad to the care of
another stranger, and, taking an affectionate farewell,
which was his last, immediately set off for
Toulon, where he embarked, and was drowned at
sea some few months afterwards.</p>

<p>“Had the worthy bailli lived, the destiny of
Charles Maurice would have been far different, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
the fate of Europe have been changed. He would
have found protection and support in his own
family—in one of its members at least—and they
would not have dared to wreak upon his head that
deadly wrong, which changed the whole current of
his existence, and compelled him to struggle and
to toil for that which was by right his own. However,
bad as matters were, they certainly might
have been worse; for the gentleman to whose care
Charles Maurice was confided, was at all events a
kind and liberal person, and soon became greatly
attached to his pupil. I have frequently seen him
at the Hotel Talleyrand, even so lately as the year
1828. He was but a very few years older than the
prince, and it was like a dream of other days to
hear the ancient pupil and his more ancient tutor
discourse for hours together of those early times, so
long gone by, and of their friends and companions,
all, with very few exceptions, long since in the
grave. I have often thought that it must have been
to the society and counsels of this most excellent
man that the prince chiefly owed the softness and
humanity of his character, which even his enemies,
amid all their absurd accusations, have never been
able to deny.</p>

<p>“I have heard the prince, even very lately,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
speak of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ce cher</i> Père Langlois, as one of the most
benevolent and pure-minded of men, and his friendship
and affection for him knew no change, through
all the vicissitudes of fortune, or the changes in
politics. The prince, I believe, allowed him a very
handsome income up to the day of his death; but
this circumstance did not prevent him from sometimes
indulging his quondam pupil with a few
gentle remonstrances and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">réprésentations</i>, whenever,
by any misplaced word, or ill-timed reflection,
he wounded the old professor’s prejudices;
and it was a most curious sight to witness the
deference with which his observations would be
received by the prince, who, so strong was the
power of old association, bowed his mighty intellect,
and submitted to the reprimands of the obscure
and dependent professor. I have often been present
at his visits, and always took most especial
delight in witnessing the kindly feeling, the true
affection, which existed between the pair. M.
Langlois still wore, in 1828, the costume he had
worn before the revolution, when, as professor of
rhetoric at the college of Louis le Grand, he had
undertaken the care and education of the poor
neglected boy from the distant village in Perigord—a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
long-skirted black coat, without a collar, and
buttoned up to the chin, black knee breeches and
silk stockings, with large shoes and bright plated
knee-buckles. His coiffure was in <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ailes de pigeon</i>,
with a long and goodly queue, well powdered; the
large, flat snuff-box which he drew from the vasty
deep of his ample pocket, and the brown checquered
handkerchief which he used with a flourish and a
loud report, brought back to memory at once the
whole herd of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">savans crasseux</i> of the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p>“Well, to return to my tale. At the college,
Charles Maurice devoted himself most manfully to
study. This is proved by the fact of his having
obtained, the second year of his admission, the
first prize of his class, although competition must
have been hard with boys who had been in the
college for many years, while he had been running
wild and barefoot on the plains of Perigord. Three
years passed away cheerily enough at the college.
His life of study had, however, but little variety,
for he was during that time one of the unfavoured
few who were compelled by the arrangements of
their parents to remain at the college during the
short vacation. His mother came but seldom to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
visit him, and never came alone. She was mostly
accompanied by an eminent surgeon of Paris, who
examined the boy’s leg, and bandaged it and pulled
it out to force it to match in length with the other,
and burnt and cauterized the offending nerve until
the poor fellow learned to dread with extreme terror
the summons to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">parloir</i>, and the announcement
that <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">madame sa mère</i> was awaiting him there. I
have often heard him tell of the agony of these
visits, and of the disappointment which he experienced
on seeing all his playmates depart to their
various homes for the holidays, but I never heard
him utter a single complaint or condemnation of
his mother’s conduct.</p>

<p>“It was at this time that his father died from the
consequences of an old wound received in a skirmish
some years before, and Charles Maurice was
now the Comte de Talleyrand, and head of that
branch of the family to which he belonged. Meanwhile,
the younger son, Archambaut, had likewise
returned from his most refined and tender nursing;
but <em>he</em> had had the better chance; <em>his</em> limbs were
sound and well developed, as God had made them.
No dire accident, the consequence of foul neglect,
had marred his shape or tarnished his comeliness.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
So, one fine day, and as a natural consequence, mark
you, of this fortunate circumstance, when Charles
Maurice, the <em>eldest</em> son, had finished his course of
study at Louis le Grand, having passed through
his classes with great <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">éclat</i>, there came a tall,
sallow, black-robed priest, and took him away from
the midst of friends to the grim old <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">seminaire</i> of
St. Sulpice, and it was there that he received the
astounding intimation, from the lips of the superior
himself, that, by the decision of a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">conseil de famille</i>,
from which there was no appeal, his birthright had
been taken from him, and transferred to his younger
brother.</p>

<p>“‘Why so?’ faltered the boy, unable to conceal
his emotion.</p>

<p>“‘He is not a cripple,’ was the stern and cruel
answer.</p>

<p>“It must have been that hour—nay, that very
instant—the echo of those heartless words—which
made the Prince de Talleyrand what he is even to
this very day. Who shall tell the bitter throes of
that bold, strong-hearted youth, as he heard the
unjust sentence? Was it defiance and despair,
the gift of hell, or resignation, the blessed boon of
Heaven, which caused him to suffer the coarse,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
black robe to be thrown at once above his college
uniform, without a cry, without a murmur? None
will ever be able to divine what his feelings were,
for this one incident is always passed over by the
prince. He never refers to it, even when in familiar
conversation with his most loved intimates. It is
certain, therefore, that the single hour of which I
speak, bore with it a whole life of bitterness and
agony.</p>

<p>“It is evident, as usual with him throughout his
whole life, that his decision, however, was taken on
the instant. He murmured not—he sued not for
commutation of the hateful sentence. He knew
that it would be in vain. He even sought at once
to conform, outwardly at least, to all the tedium of
the endless rules and regulations by which the
house was governed; but his whole character was
changed—his very nature was warped and blasted.
Whatever historians may write, and credulous
readers choose to believe, he was <em>not</em> a ‘silent,
solitary boy, loving to muse while his comrades
played around him,’ as I have seen it written in a
recent account of his life. Just the contrary. While
at Louis le Grand, he was remarkable for his skill
and dexterity at all kinds of games requiring either<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
fleetness of foot or strength of limb; which fact was
so extraordinary, from his infirmity, that the tradition
has been preserved in the college. He was strong
and hardy, in spite of his lameness. This he owed
to the fresh air and free exercise he had enjoyed
in his early childhood. His temper was mild and
tractable, and, when attacked, his only weapon of
defence was his tongue. His sharp, quick speech
became, indeed, the terror of his comrades. Even
then he had learned that the art of governing others
consisted merely in self-command. What a pity
that some of his juvenile <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bon mots</i> have not been
preserved; they must have been delightful; the
very sap and freshness of his mental vigour.</p>

<p>“At Louis le Grand he had been surrounded by
the bold, ambitious spirits of the rising generation
of that day, boys of all classes of society, all animated
with the same eager desire for distinction,
and, each in his degree, with the same thirst for
glory. Even these children were awaking to the
conviction that a new light was about to break upon
the world, that the triumph of mind over matter was
nigh at hand, and that the power of brute force must
yield at length to the mightier power of intellect.
A discontented spirit had gone forth, and even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
walked abroad into the very nurseries throughout
the land. The days were past when the boys of
noble blood sat down to table first and were served
by the urchin <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">roturiers</i>, their fellow-students. At
board, in class, or at play, the sons of the noble
and the lowly, of the wealthy and the poor, were
now jostled together. The high-born dunce, who
was at college merely to while away the useless
years between the epoch of actual childhood and
that of his admission (still a child) into the army,
no longer took precedence of the plebeian boy who
was toiling and striving to acquire knowledge, even
though it might have been the credit of the former
which obtained the admission of the latter into the
college.</p>

<p>“In this struggle, the talents and quickness of
young Talleyrand had shone conspicuously. His
position on his first entrance into the college had
been most undefined and false. He had arrived
from Perigord wild and untutored, ignorant of the
simplest social tradition of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">noblesse</i>; therefore
had he no place or influence among the nobles;
while, without wealth, or any of the dazzling appurtenances
of his rank at command, he could scarcely
be expected to have sway with the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">roturiers</i>; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>
yet, before the first half year had passed away, he
was found to be the prime mover and counsel of
both factions by the power of his intellect alone.
These are facts which still live in the memory of
some few of the prince’s old associates, and show
how early that grasping mind, which was destined
to govern those who governed the world itself,
began to assert its dominion and to exercise its
powers.</p>

<p>“I have dwelt thus lengthily upon the childhood
of the Prince de Talleyrand, because, in the events
by which it was marked, you may find both cause
and excuse for many things that took place in after
years. Such had been his life at Louis le Grand.
Now, at the Seminaire, he was thrown at once
among a set of creatures of a far different stamp
from the bold and independent beings he had left.
His new companions were mostly, like himself
sons of the poor <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">noblesse</i>; but, unlike himself,
they were either the <em>younger</em> or the <em>bastard</em> sons.
Not one of these had been deprived, as he had
been, of his name and birthright, therefore none
could have sympathy with all the bitterness that
must have lain so heavy on his heart. Instead of
the variety which gave such interest to his college<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>
life, and such constant food to his perceptive
powers, he was surrounded in his new abode by
beings all actuated by one single motive, and who
had therefore been moulded by the same views into
the same character. The sleepy dream of life at
St. Sulpice centred wholly in ecclesiastical distinction
and honour, and merely resolved itself
into either riches or dignities, according to the
temper of the dreamer. The ready wit, the lively
perceptions of young Talleyrand, could not be
appreciated in a community where hope was deadened,
and imagination dulled, by the certainty that
robbed the Future of the dim veil with which it is
hidden from the great mass of mankind, and which,
according to the morals of the period, rendered
the after years of the younger son of the poor
noble, or the bastard child of the rich one, as easily
to be defined, and as easy to unravel as a record of
the past. So must have thought that little congregation
of the Seminaire of Saint Sulpice, who were
gathered there in 1770, the year of the admission
of Charles Maurice. But God had ordained it
otherwise; and, could some few of the fortunes of
those lads be told at this day, we should perhaps
find as great diversity of adventure, and many a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
tale of interest as wild and fearful, as those which
could be furnished by the youthful denizens of the
Royal College of Louis le Grand at the same
period.</p>

<p>“However, it does not appear that the young
candidate for church preferment was guilty, for a
single moment, of deception, with regard to those
who had thus fashioned out his destiny. He wore
no mask of hypocrisy at that time certainly, made
no false pretence of fasting or of penance; but
openly and freely shared in all the amusements
which were within his reach, perhaps buoyed up
with the presentiment that the time was drawing
nigh when the cowled monk and the stoled priest
would be bound by no obligation to keep the vow
which had been breathed from terror or necessity.</p>

<p>“It is pleasant to listen to his quiet and even
mirthful tales of the life he led when staying at the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">succursale</i> of the establishment, which was situated
at Vaugirard, near which place (at Issy) the Duchess
of Orleans, mother of our present King Louis
Philippe, possessed a most splendid château. Here
she used to assemble all the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">élite</i> of the society of
Paris, and on the boards of the little theatre belonging
to the château were first produced some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span>
of the dramatic pieces which afterwards had the
greatest vogue in the capital. To be present at
these representations was an honour, of course, far
beyond the pretensions of the poor seminaristes,
whose ears were tantalized during the long summer
nights by the rattling of carriage-wheels, and the
hallooing of livered attendants, as all the rank and
beauty of Paris flew by the old gray convent, where
the priestly inhabitants should have been slumbering
in holy calm. But young Talleyrand slumbered
not. He would remain gazing for hours
through the narrow apertures of the jalousies,—which
the watchful eye of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">surveillant</i> caused
always to be closed,—and, with straining eyes and
yearning heart, seek to picture to his fancy the
faces and the forms of the fair occupants of the
carriages which passed in rapid succession, until
the desire to join the happy groups he beheld thus
fleeting before him became irresistible, and he
resolved <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coûte que coûte</i> to gratify it. No sooner
was the resolution formed than he hastened to its
execution.</p>

<p>“Accordingly, one bright balmy night in August,
he flung his black serge frock <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">aux orties</i>, and,
without assistance and without a confidant (he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
never asked or took advice), he climbed the old
crumbling wall of the garden, and jumped up behind
one of the gay carriages which had so excited
his envy. He will sometimes smile even now at
the self-confidence with which he planted himself,
all terrified and blushing, however, at the heels of
the party who alighted at the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">perron</i> of the château.
He was fairly astonished at his own impudence,
when he found himself comfortably seated in
the parterre of the theatre, with an officer of the
Gardes Françaises on one side, and a little masked
and mincing <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">abbé petit-maître</i> on the other; nor
could he believe, as he raised his eyes and gazed
around on that bright and brilliant company, that
he was not in reality where he ought at that moment
to have been, stretched on his lowly pallet,
and dreaming of paradise.</p>

<p>“When the curtain rose, and the play began,
his admiration and delight became almost painful.
The piece was Racine’s ‘Phèdre,’ and the famous
Mademoiselle Contat, who performed the part of
the wretched wife and mother, was in more senses
than one the heroine of the evening. She had just
been released from the prison of Fort l’Evêque,
where she had been confined for some time, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span>
consequence of having refused to apologize to the
Paris parterre, for treating its opinion and authority
with contempt. Enthusiasm was at its height
on her account. Party spirit had run so high,
that duels had been fought between old friends,
and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">liaisons</i> of long standing been broken off,
in consequence of differences of opinion with regard
to her conduct in this matter. Madame de
L——, a great patroness of the drama, had not
hesitated at making herself the public talk, by
taking to prison, in her open carriage in broad
day, and in the face of all Paris, seated on her
lap, with dishevelled hair and streaming eyes, the
fair and injured Emilie! The new perfume, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">larmes
de Contat</i>, had become indispensable. Better go
without a pocket-handkerchief at all than produce
one which was not redolent of the complicated fragrance.
There had been but a single incident to
divert from tears and sobs in this adventure. The
police-officer, who had been charged with the
arrest of Mademoiselle Contat, had found her in
the tragic mood, lofty and sullen. ‘Take all!’ she
had exclaimed, with theatrical grandeur; ‘you are
welcome to take all—my liberty—my very life
itself—but you cannot take my honour!’ ‘Fear not,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>
mademoiselle,’ replied the man; ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">où il n’y a rien,
le roi perd ses droits</i>.’</p>

<p>“Some had laughed at the witticism—others had
felt it most deeply, as the unkindest cut of all. In
short, her punishment and its cause had created a
species of frenzy in the public mind, which had
occasioned all minor troubles, whether of politics
or finance, to be forgotten for a while. You may
judge, then, of the effect produced by the appearance
of Mdlle. Contat on the stage of this little
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">théâtre de bonne compagnie</i>, before an audience
of whom she was the idol, and who had taken
her imprisonment as the deepest personal offence
to themselves. Every individual in the house
rose and greeted her with transport. There was
loud clapping of hands, and stamping of feet;
and some wept salt tears, and embraced their
neighbours lovingly, so great was the common joy,
so universal the gratification afforded by the release
of the great Contat! Charles Maurice alone
remained impassible amid all the clamour, for he
knew not what it meant, until the Garde Française
gave him a cuff, and bade him shout, or he would
pink him, and the perfumed abbé fell upon his
neck, and with sobs begged him, for Heaven’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span>
sake, to clap his hands, that he might be quite
sure he was not seated next to a corpse, for nothing
else could thus long have borne the presence of a
beauty so divine without some demonstration of
delight.</p>

<p>“It was when the clamour had ceased, and the
play was allowed to proceed, that the real delight
of young Talleyrand commenced. I have often
heard him say, that never, during the lengthened
years of his brilliant life, does he remember to
have experienced an admiration so glowing, so
intense, as on that memorable evening. During
the whole of the performance, he had remained in
a perfect trance, and, when it was concluded, he
almost wept at the thought that he might possibly
behold it no more. The play was followed by a
supper, again followed by dancing, which doubtless
lasted till the dawn, but our seminariste
deemed it prudent to hasten homeward before
matins, for fear of detection. This he accomplished
on foot, and with celerity, and he was just
comfortably settled in his bed when the odious
clang of the chapel bell roused him ere he had yet
fallen asleep. And it was long, indeed, before he
again slept calmly as he had done before. That<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
night’s entrancement had opened to his sight visions
of forbidden things, of which till then he had never
dreamed, and the possibility of returning again with
composure to the dull life of the seminaire was
gone for ever! His passion for Mademoiselle
Contat grew to be the one sole thought which occupied
his mind, and he soon found means to indulge
it. Night after night would he escape from
his prison, and walk to Paris (after her return to
the Théâtre Royal), in order to witness the least
fragment of her acting. Sometimes, on the vigils
of great festivals, when prayers had continued late
at the chapel, or the superior had indulged his
flock with an over-long story at the supper-table,
the poor youth could not set out on his perilous
journey until it was too late; and many a time has
he had the mortification of arriving at the theatre,
after an expensive ride or a fatiguing walk from
Vaugirard, just as the curtain was about to fall,
and shut out the goddess from his sight. He often
recalls those few short months of peril and excitement,
as among the happiest of his life.</p>

<p>“It was just about this time that he met with a
romantic adventure, which he cannot even now
relate without emotion, and which has all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">198</a></span>
character of the events which compose the most
pure and healthy of the novels of the period. He
was one day returning from the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bibliothèque</i> of
the Sorbonne to the Seminaire Saint Sulpice, laden
with books and papers, when a violent storm of
rain coming on, he was forced to seek shelter beneath
a gateway in the Rue du Pot de Fer. The
neighbourhood at that time was full of convents
and ecclesiastical establishments—the Benedictines—the
Carmelites—the Frères Minimes—the Cordeliers—all
had houses or <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">succursales</i>, about the
Place Saint Sulpice; so that you might have walked
down whole streets of dark gloomy wall, without
finding a single refuge from the rain—the convent
doors being kept inhospitably closed, and the small
space beneath the eaves being even more drenched
than the middle of the street, from the dripping
gutters which poured down upon the miserable
wayfarer one continued sheet of water, certainly
not so pure as that which fell straight from heaven.
There was but a single space in the whole street
where the passenger could hope for a dry footing,
and young Talleyrand knew it well; a little archway,
leading to the back-door of a convent of
Benedictines—the name of which I forget—whose
principal entrance was in the Rue de Vaugirard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span>
“It was a long, narrow passage, so dark that it
was impossible to perceive any one concealed
there, and might have served admirably as a place
of ambush for any lurking thief or assassin, who
might have chosen to harbour in its gloomy recess.
Here the youth had stood some time watching the
rain—which continued to fall in torrents—still
laden with his books, yet not daring to open one
of them, fearful that the rest might fall into the
mud—of course devoured with <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ennui</i>, and stamping
with impatience,—just, in fact, on the point of
launching forth once more—if it were merely for
the sake of changing his station for another more
amusing,—when suddenly he became conscious of
the presence of another person in the passage.
He says that he was rather startled at first, but it
did not belong either to his age or character to
pass without investigation any circumstance which
had arrested his attention: so clearing his throat
with a successful effort, he called out manfully,
‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Qui vive?</i>’</p>

<p>“The exclamation was answered by a faint and
stifled cry, issuing from the very furthermost corner
of the obscure passage. The young man ventured
forward without hesitation, and discovered a dark
and shapeless form huddled up in one corner of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>
the threshold of the convent-door, whose outline,
so dark was the place, was invisible, even at arm’s
length. He was conscious that the form was that
of a female, and he stretched out his hand, and
said kindly,—‘What fear you?—are you in trouble?—why
are you hidden thus? Let me assist you, if
you are in pain.’</p>

<p>“As he spoke these words, the figure slowly
rose—a slight, frail, delicate form, that of a girl
scarcely beyond the age of childhood, attired in
the loose black dress of serge and large capuchon
of the convent beneath the gateway of which they
were standing. He took her gently by the hand
and led her forward to the light. The poor girl
was so terrified, that she offered no resistance, and,
conducting her to the entrance of the passage, he
gently withdrew the capuchon, with which she had
covered her face, bidding her take comfort, for
that he would do her no harm. The girl looked
up into his countenance with an expression of
anxiety and doubt, but the gentle kindness which
she saw written there must have relieved her instantly,
for she exclaimed, in a whisper, ‘Oh no—I
<em>know</em> you will not betray me—but how <em>can</em> you
assist me? I am lost for ever!’ and then she
buried her face in her hands, and sobbed aloud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span>
“The youth remained gazing upon the girl, in
mingled admiration and surprise. Never, to this
very hour, he has often said, has he beheld a face
of greater beauty than that which stood thus revealed
to him in the dim light. It was a small
and exquisitely delicate cast of countenance, with
large wild eyes and arched eyebrows, and a calm,
snow-white forehead, which a painter might have
given to the Madonna standing at Saint Anne’s
knee. Her hair was hanging loose about her face,
in dripping masses, from the rain through which
she had passed, and the steam of the capuchon.
Her small chiselled mouth was parted, and disclosed
two rows of pearly teeth. But Talleyrand
was most struck by the singular beauty of her
complexion, which, although she evidently had
been terrified, was not pale, but of the most vivid
bloom, like the petals of the damask rose; while
her eyes almost dazzled him, so bright and flashing
was their lustre. By his patience and his
kindly manner, he soon succeeded in winning the
little maiden’s confidence; and, although still in
great agitation, she told him the story of her
troubles, which was a singular one, and most
affecting.</p>

<p>“She said that she was a novice of the convent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
of the Benedictine ladies, of the Rue de Vaugirard,
and that the passage where they were standing
formed part of the premises belonging to the
building. She had been in that house ever since
the age of four years—she was now fifteen—and
during all that time she had never once been
allowed to go beyond those walls. She had often
yearned most intensely, she said, to see the world,
which the other novices and the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pensionnaires</i> had
described to her as being so very beautiful. She
had sometimes begged very earnestly, too, to be
permitted to accompany one of the lay sisters, who
went sometimes into the country, to see a sick nun
of the order, who was staying there for the recovery
of her health; but she had been told that
out of kindness she must be refused; for, as it was
her destiny to pass her whole life in that old convent,
it would be much better that she should
behold no other place, and those who had more
experience than herself could tell what regret and
misery she would avoid by her ignorance of other
scenes. She was to have renewed her vows of
novitiate on the Thursday before, but she had
been so ill, that the ceremony had been deferred
until the week following, and then she should enter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
into the last year of novitiate, and when that had
passed away, she should take the black veil and be
cloistered for the rest of her life. Her name, she
added, was Constance de V., but she knew not of
any friends or kindred which she had. A notary
had always remitted to the abbess the sums necessary
for the expenses of her board and education,
and the dower money also was already lodged in
the lady’s hands, so that there was no hope—none—none—that
she should ever realize her dream of
beholding ever so small a portion of the world, of
whose beauty she had heard so much. She said
this with such a deep sigh, and such a yearning
look towards the gloomy street where the rain still
plashed in torrents, that the listener was moved
almost to tears.</p>

<p>“‘But how came you here, mademoiselle?’ said
he, ‘and in this state, too?’ pointing to her dress,
which was wet through, and clung to her form in
damp and streaming folds.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, I have not told you all,’ replied she,
hesitatingly. ‘I know that I have done wrong,
but my punishment is great as my offence:’ and
she looked down the dark passage towards the
door with a shudder of affright. ‘But thus it was.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span>
I had been ill in bed for more than a week, and
had grown so weary of my little cell—and last
night I could not sleep for thinking of all the
brightness of the world I never was to see. I
prayed to the Holy Virgin to take away these
wicked thoughts from my mind, but she did not
think fit to give me grace, for towards morning my
desire to go abroad became even more intense;
and so, when sister Marthe, who watches me, left
me, still thinking that I was asleep, to go to matins,
I rose from my bed and came down, to walk for a
few moments beneath the cloisters of the outer
court, in the hope that the air of the place, confined
as it was, might help to cool the fever of the
past night. I have long been forbidden to go into
the garden; they say it is too cold and damp,
and that my cough will be worse than ever if I
stay beneath the trees. Well, I turned round and
round the court, listening to the chimes of Saint
Sulpice, and thinking of what our Lady Abbess
tells me I should never think of—the delight of
lying in some cool green meadow, on the grass,
beneath the overhanging branches of some old
tree—when the tempter, who, as Sister Marthe has
often told me, already half possesses my lost soul<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>
(alas! she <em>must</em> speak truth), led me this way—into
the cloister which leads to yonder door. It
was ajar—Mother Jeanne, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">femme de peine</i>,
had just been cleaning it with broom and pail, and
had opened it to sweep the rubbish into this dark
passage. How she could have left it open thus I
cannot tell—yes, Sister Marthe is right—it <em>must</em>
have been the tempter’s work! My heart beat
violently at sight of that open door. I thought to
have fled, but I yielded to temptation, and peeped
through the long dark passage into the street
beyond. Scarcely had I thus gazed for an instant,
when I was seized with a desire so burning, so
intense, to see the <em>Place</em>, which I had been told
was at the end of this little street, that, without a
moment’s reflection, I rushed down the passage and
was free. I meant to have merely cast one look
upon the <em>Place</em>, and have returned immediately.
I thought it might be possible that in this illness I
might die, and it was very hard that I should leave
a world, which they tell me God has made so full
of beauty, without having beheld aught besides
this dull old pile; so I stepped out into the street
with more delight than I ought to have done, considering
that I was doing what was wrong. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>
buried my head in my capuchon, and turned boldly
down the street to the left; but I had not gone far
before I perceived that I must have taken the
wrong direction, for as I drew near to the end, I
saw not the fine open square which I had been
promised, but another street more dirty and more
dull than the one I had just traversed. During
the walk, I did not meet a soul, or I think I should
have fainted, for it was not till I thus stood for the
first time alone and unaided that I remembered
that my dress must at once betray me. I was resolved
to return immediately, but, in the mean time,
this storm of rain came suddenly beating down
with such intense fury that my dress was wet
through in an instant. I ran with all the swiftness
of which I was capable, to regain this dark passage;
but judge of the agony of affright that I
experienced on beholding the door which I had
closed, and of which I had taken the key, fastened
on the inside! Mother Jeanne must have perceived
the absence of the key, and have bolted it
within. Oh, I am lost! She has doubtless already
been to tell our lady mother. They will all know
’tis I who am the guilty one, for everybody else
will be at matins!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>
“As the poor girl concluded her story, she again
burst into a paroxysm of grief. The young seminariste
endeavoured to soothe her, and offered to
go round to the great gate to try and obtain admittance
there, but the trembling girl clung to
him with such energy, that he could not tear himself
away.</p>

<p>“‘No, no; do not leave me now,’ exclaimed she.
‘I dare not be left thus alone. What shall I say
when they come and find me here? They will
come, I know, directly, and bear me back with
hootings and with shame.’</p>

<p>“As she spoke, so great was her terror, that she
shook like the aspen leaf, and her companion was
obliged to support her by placing his arm gently
round her waist, or she would have fallen. He
then perceived, with great distress, that this violent
trembling was the spasmodic shuddering of fever;
and, as she placed her hand upon her bosom to
still the convulsive throe, he beheld with yet greater
horror that she wore nothing beneath her robe but
the night dress which she had on when she left her
bed. His heart was wrung at the thought of that
delicate creature abroad thus, burnt with fever,
and wet to the skin. It must be death to so fragile<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">208</a></span>
a being. Something, however, must be done. He
durst not leave her. She was in that state of mind
that she might have fallen senseless to the earth if
she had been left alone; neither could he drag her
with him the whole length of the street through the
pouring rain, in order to arrive at the great gate of
the convent. The scandal would have been terrific,
had they been seen together in the costume which
they each wore. In the midst of this painful embarrassment,
like the drowning man who clings to
a straw, he went up to the door and turned the
key. There was no impediment in the lock. He
shook the door violently, then pushed it with all
his might. Oh, God of mercy, it yields! It is
<em>not</em> bolted, for daylight may be seen through the
opening. Once more he brings all his strength to
bear against the iron-studded door. The drops of
sweat stand like beads upon his forehead, with the
anxiety of the moment and the violence of his
exertions. But he is presently rewarded by the
grating noise caused by the removal of the obstacle
within, and the faint shriek of joy which escaped
the lips of the sweet Constance. She sees it all
now! Mother Jeanne, in her rage for cleaning,
had moved the old oaken bench from the archway<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
of the cloister, and had placed it crosswise before the
door, where it had resisted all her own puny efforts,
as though it had been a wall of iron; and now her
laugh of delight is so convulsive that it is more
painful than were her tears and sobs. Meanwhile,
young Talleyrand had pushed open a space sufficient
for her passage into the cloister, and he
assisted her to mount the bench and pass through.
The hand which she gave him, and which but a
little while before had startled him by its burning
touch, was now as cold as marble. He imprinted
one pure and holy kiss upon it before he closed
the door for ever; and when he found that she
withdrew it not, but thanked him, and blessed him
fervently, and called him her deliverer, and said
‘<em>that he had saved her life</em>,’ he shut the door
abruptly, for he could bear no more. He stood
for a moment listening at the keyhole for the sound
of her retreating step. It must have been very
light, however, for he heard it not. He then
walked slowly home to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">seminaire</i>, insensible
now to either wind or rain.</p>

<p>“The books which the young student had
brought from the Sorbonne were unperused that
day. His mind was too much absorbed with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span>
memory of that beauteous maiden, and with the
undefined terror which he experienced for her
sake. On the morrow, he walked several times
completely round the convent walls, but he saw
not an evidence that the building was inhabited by
a single human being. On the third day, he could
not control his impatience, and bestowed a silver
crown on the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">commissionaire</i> to go and ask, as if
despatched by some great lady, whose name he
was to forget, for news of the health of Mademoiselle
Constance de V. The answer he brought
back was that ‘Mademoiselle Constance de V., in
an attack of fever, being for a few moments unwatched,
had risen from her bed and gone down
into the cloisters, no doubt feeling grievously ill,
and in search of assistance. It was supposed that
she had wandered for some time in the quadrangle,
for she was found lying drenched with wet upon
the oaken bench, by the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">porte de service</i> of the
outer court. She was without sense or motion
when taken up, and it was certain that she had
already been dead for some time (this was the private
opinion of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tourière</i>), although the superior
would insist on having the viaticum administered
all the same. She had been buried that very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">211</a></span>
morning at daybreak, and Mademoiselle de Breteuil,
the favourite <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pensionnaire</i> of the abbess, had
got the promise of her cell to keep her birds in,
until the arrival of another <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pensionnaire</i> to occupy
it. The abbess was very angry with sister Marthe
for having left the bedside of Mademoiselle de V.,
but could not punish her, it having been proved
that she had only gone to matins.</p>

<p>“Such had been the fate of that beauteous girl!
The earth already covered her, before she had even
seen the light. That stealthy walk along the
dreary street, amid the cold and pelting rain, was
all the experience she had earned to the grave, of
the world she had longed so ardently to see; and,
when the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">seminariste</i> thought on the story of her
life, and compared it with his own, he felt that he
no longer had a right to complain. He had spent
his childhood at least amid fresh air and free exercise
wholesome to the body, and also amid the
rude kindness and overwhelming affection wholesome
to the mind; while the poor child whose
dying grasp he almost fancied that he could still
feel, had never been allowed to roam beyond the
gloomy precincts of her prison-house. With her
innocence and loveliness, she had been suffered to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">212</a></span>
grow like some rank weed which springs amid the
crevice of the pavement stone of the foul jail-yard,
and struggles but in vain to catch a gleam of
sunshine or a breath of air, until, wearied with the
effort, it sinks back dead into the crevice from
which it sprung.</p>

<p>“This event made a great impression upon M. de
Talleyrand, and sobered him for some time after
its occurrence. He took to studying more diligently
than hitherto, and shone among his competitors
as brilliantly as he had already done at
Louis le Grand. His speeches at the conferences
which were held every month at Saint Sulpice,
were judged to be masterpieces of reasoning and
logic, and were thought worthy of being preserved
among the records of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">seminaire</i>—an immense
honour for so young a man. He was now seventeen:
it was judged advisable that he should go to
finish his theological studies ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en Sorbonne</i>,’ and it
was during the short interval which elapsed between
leaving the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">seminaire</i> and entering the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Sorbonne</i>,
that he first lodged at home. Note this
when ye talk of the ‘good old times:’—the Prince
de Talleyrand was seventeen years of age <em>before he
had slept a single night beneath his father’s roof</em>!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
Well might Jean Jacques thunder forth his maledictions
upon the fine ladies, the ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">marâtres sans
entrailles</i>’ of his day!”</p>

<p>My friend here paused, to my great sorrow, with
all the self-complacency of a professed lion exhibitor,
to descant upon the beauty of the landscape
as seen from the point at which we had
arrived. Of course there were the well-known wonders
familiar to all natural-beauty-hunters ever
since the world began—the seeing into so many
departments—the commanding a view of so many
parishes, but which always worry me to death.</p>

<p>“What is that ruin?” said I, pointing to a pile
of rubbish which lay close at hand.</p>

<p>“Ah, that is no ruin,” replied C., laughing, “it
is just the contrary, for it is an unfinished building.
The history of that ‘ruin’ would amuse you, more
than all the history of the person whose work it
was. The prince calls it the ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Folie Princesse</i>,’
and you shall have the story as we go home.”</p>

<span class="subhead">MIRABEAU—THE PRINCESS T.—THE MAYOR OF VALENÇAY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>We alighted from the carriage, and sat down on
one of the blocks of stone which lay scattered
about in all directions, bearing witness to the
gigantic intentions of the projector, and also to the
signal failure of the enterprise. C. looked around
with sadness.</p>

<p>“The sight of this place,” said he, “recalls to
mind so much both of pain and pleasure, so many
associations for ever lost to Valençay, that I cannot
behold it without a certain feeling of melancholy,
which I little thought it would ever have inspired.
And yet, in spite of all the jesting and merry sarcasm,
the bon-mots and epigrams to which the
first discovery of the little monument gave rise, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">215</a></span>
might serve to illustrate my favourite argument,
when answering those who attack, by sweeping
generalities, the whole life of the prince, and which
I frame thus: ‘No man can be so very worthless
who has made such friendships as he has done,
and won attachments so lasting and so true.’</p>

<p>“It is, in fact, one of the most extraordinary
qualifications of this great man, and forms a parallel
to what is told of the fascinating influence of
Napoleon. His powers of pleasing are so great,
that he can with justice boast of never having
failed to captivate, where he has been willing to do
so, even when having to combat enmity and prejudice.
Those who are accustomed to the bland
and polished courtesy of his old age can readily
imagine that in youth his influence must have been
all-powerful. With this fascination of manner he
must have also been possessed of the most aristocratic
and handsome person, from the dignity of
which, strange to say, the deformity of his foot
never detracted. He was very fair, of most brilliant
yet delicate complexion, with eyes of a soft dark
blue, much covered by the lids, which contributed
greatly to the air of quiet <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">recueillement</i>, misconstrued
by many into an expression of cunning,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>
which was habitual to him. His hair has always
been considered one of his greatest attractions,
being of the bright golden hue, so uncommon even
in the north; and when he wore it loose over his
shoulders, neither discoloured by powder nor disfigured
by the torturing iron of the perruquier, it
must have been most beautiful. Even to this very
hour, you cannot fail to remark its rich luxuriance.
It is not yet wholly white, but merely grey, and its
original golden colour still shines bright amid the
silver.</p>

<p>“I have seen several portraits of the prince,
taken in his youth. There is one, a miniature,
which, set in a bracelet, has met my eye every day
for some years past, upon the arm of the fair
Duchess de D., which never fails to arrest my
attention, and to inspire me with the same interest,
the same dreams and illusions of the past,
as though, upon each occasion I behold it, it was
for the first time. The likeness may be strongly
traced even now. The features are moulded with
a delicacy peculiar to the race of the Perigords,
and the countenance is one which might certainly
have been suspected of having greatly aided his
varied talents and endowments, in the success for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span>
which he was so applauded and so envied. The
costume in this picture is of about the year 1775,
when Talleyrand was in the prime of youth, and
when he had not long emerged from St. Sulpice;
and yet the portrait is rather that of a young
man of fashion of the time than of a youth vowed
to a life of penance and austerity. The hair, of
which he was always proud, hangs loose and unshorn
over his embroidered coat; no sign of
monkish scissors or of priestly tonsure is there.
There does not exist a picture of the prince either
as Abbé de Perigord or as Bishop of Autun. So
completely did he ever separate himself from the
state of life into which he had been thrust by the
force of circumstances, that he never would consent
to have a palpable record of his profession brought
in after times as a memorial against him. There
is a beautiful portrait of Talleyrand when Prince
de Benevent and Vice Grand Elector, painted by Gerard,
and one of the best performances of that
artist, now at Rochecotte, wherein the physiognomist
might have <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">beau jeu</i>, for the countenance in
this picture bears the most lively and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">spirituel</i> expression
that could possibly be represented by art.
The painting by Scheffer, which has been engraved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>
in London, and published by Colnaghi, is the
best in existence as to the likeness, which is most
striking. The artist has represented, in a manner
almost sublime, the peculiar <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mélange</i> of melancholy
and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">finesse</i> which the countenance of the prince
always wears when in meditation,—an expression
which sometimes inspires me with a feeling of the
deepest sadness; it is the cheerfulness of the mind
contending against physical infirmity and pain.</p>

<p>“You will readily believe that, with all the advantages
both of mind and person which he possessed—with
ambition of that quiet kind, which
knows no obstacle in the attainment of its ends,
and yet can wait with calm and bide its time—which
is slow to decide, yet quick to move when
the hour is arrived for action—with the courtly
manners which must have been hereditary, joined
to the calm dignity which he had acquired in the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Séminaire</i> de St. Sulpice, his first appearance in
the world wherein he was destined to live and
move, was hailed with peculiar triumph and satisfaction.
The fame of his skill in argument, his
subtlety in wrangling, had got beyond the walls of
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Séminaire</i>, long before he himself had left it
for the independence of the Sorbonne. The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">conférences</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">219</a></span>
which took place weekly in the old hall of
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Séminaire</i> had brought out his powers of persuasion,
and his great quickness of imagination,
which displayed itself admirably in pointed epigram
and brilliant repartee.</p>

<p>“There are people living even now who can remember
the effect which some of his controversial
arguments produced at the time, among the
audiences who enjoyed the privilege of a seat
upon the old oaken benches of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Séminaire</i>, on
the days reserved for these public discussions.
They must have been <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chefs-d’œuvres</i>, full of point
and pith, and generally sent the listeners away
laughing with him, and sympathising with his adversary.
These discourses were always read in
public from a manuscript <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cahier</i>, and were preserved
in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">archives</i> of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Séminaire</i>, until the
revolution dispersed the whole of the property of
the establishment, and they were lost. It is a
great pity they were not preserved, as they must
have contained much of the vivacity and energy of
his youth, which were sadly wanting in his subsequent
speeches; for Talleyrand has never possessed
the qualifications necessary to the success of an
orator; his delivery was lengthened, and his voice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>
too deep and hollow to produce an effect upon a
large assembly. Had it not been for these natural
defects, all the vigour and fire of a Mirabeau
would have been reckoned as nought, compared
with the steady wit and cool philosophy of which
Talleyrand was master.</p>

<p>“The world of fashion, ever on the look-out for
novelty, stretched forth its arms to hug to its
bosom the young abbé on his first appearance
within its charmed ring. The reverend title with
which he was invested, so far from being a preventive
to his enjoyment of all the pleasures of the
corrupt society of the period, rather served as an
additional pretext for claiming his full share. The
youthful Abbé de Perigord was courted and flattered
by all parties; his sayings were repeated, his
sentiments quoted upon all occasions. The world
would now most willingly have spoiled him, and
avenged the neglect of his relations, and the
wrongs and insults which had been heaped upon
his childhood. But it was too late: he had already
learned to despise that world to whose mean prejudices
he had been made a sacrifice, and his heart
and soul were already devoted to the cause of
those whose struggles were beginning to make the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a></span>
old fabric of society quake and totter to its very
foundations. It was while he was studying at the
Sorbonne that the first shocks of the new era were
beginning to be felt; but young Talleyrand, as yet,
took no share in the struggle. His whole ambition
for the moment was devoted to retrieving lost
time in literature, and I have heard him say that
the happiest days of his existence were spent alone,
in the gloomy library of the Sorbonne, seated
coiled up on the steps of the library ladder, while
his cousin went abroad to pick up the news, and
bring home reports of the progress of events. The
practical knowledge of books which he acquired in
this way was immense, and has served him all
through life to season his conversation with quotation
or parody.</p>

<p>“He was soon, however, torn from the enjoyment
of this quiet mode of existence, by being
named coadjutor to his uncle, the Archbishop of
Rheims. From that time forward, books were laid
aside, and he returned to them no more. The
human heart became his only study, and one in
which he soon became a perfect adept. The history
of his life must prove, to every thinking mind,
that at this very period his decision was thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">222</a></span>
taken as to the line of conduct he would pursue,
and the party in politics it was his intention to
adopt, for he never gave himself up to the seductions
of that world which sought him with such
eagerness. He entered into its enjoyments, and
profited by its indulgence; but there is no record
of any strong friendship having been formed with
any of its members. He allied himself at once to
the new party, and among its leaders were his attachments
chosen. Sièyes and Mirabeau were the
beacon stars of his youth. The latter, in particular,
was known to entertain the highest opinion
of Talleyrand, and has left ample proof, in his
letters and papers, that he considered him the
only man capable of succeeding him as leader of
the party he had so triumphantly created.</p>

<p>“You will scarcely credit the assurance, that not
even to this very hour can the prince speak without
emotion of the ‘giant Mirabeau.’ I verily
believe that this affection has never been supplanted
in his bosom. It was not long since he
was compelled to break off suddenly, in the midst
of an anecdote which he was telling, wherein were
mentioned the circumstances of Mirabeau’s death.
He became all at once silent, and no one dared
request him to renew the thread of his story.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">223</a></span>
“Did you ever hear him allude to those circumstances
on any other occasion?”</p>

<p>“Once only,” replied C.; “we were alone together
in his study in the Rue St. Florentin, one
fine summer’s evening. I had been reading to
him some pages of Thiers’s ‘History of the Revolution,’
and had just closed the book, for want of
light, at the mention of Petion.</p>

<p>“‘That man,’ said the prince, ‘was the greatest
scoundrel this country ever produced. Mirabeau,
whose greatest defect in political conduct was the
extraordinary facility with which he gave himself
entirely up to the first person possessed of the
slightest show of talent, who could take off his
own hands any part of the labour, had grown
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">entiché</i> with Petion. For it was extraordinary
that Mirabeau, whose mental vigour could, Atlas-like,
have borne the world, was yet possessed of
so much physical indolence that he was seldom
known to carry out his own gigantic designs.
Upon how many occasions, when his burning eloquence,
his energy, had roused the angry lion, has
he been known to laugh in pity, to see the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">meute</i>
whom his own fiery zeal had urged into hot pursuit,
rush madly by, while he himself lay down to rest
until some newer game was started. From the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>
moment that such men as Petion, Brissot, and Condorcet,
began to surround Mirabeau, and were admitted
into his privacy, with Cabanis, whom he had
chosen as his medical attendant, I augured ill for
the future fate of my friend. Already were Mirabeau’s
views and principles grown too tame, too
reasonable, for these infuriated demagogues, and
they had several times received with ill temper his
biting sarcasms at what he called their <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">exaltation
republicaine</i>. I remember the effect produced
upon one occasion at a private meeting of his
friends, and the gloom and murmurs of rage with
which the concluding words of a speech he had
risen to make were received. ‘<em>Even supposing,
my friends, that royalty were now to be abolished,
it is not a republic that must be established—we
are not yet ripe for this—it must be a
commonwealth.</em>’ From that moment, such is my
firm belief, his ruin was decided; but whether he
really did meet his death by unfair means, or
whether it was the consequence, as was proclaimed
at the time, of excitement and fever of the blood,
brought on by over-exertion and anxiety, none can
tell to this hour. The circumstances of his death
will certainly justify, both to his friends and to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">225</a></span>
posterity, every suspicion of poison; while, on the
other hand, there were no symptoms which could
not be accounted for by the complaint under
which it had from the first been proclaimed that he
was sinking.’</p>

<p>“The prince paused for a moment, and I feared
that he was about to fall into a reverie, as is sometimes
the case when he has called up any touching
souvenir of his early days; but presently he
resumed:</p>

<p>“‘It was just such an evening as this, warm,
glowing, early spring, when the fiery spirit of
Mirabeau was passing away. The whole thing had
been so sudden, so unlooked-for, that we could
scarcely believe him in danger, before we learned
that he was gone. It was the 2nd of April, and
but two days before, he had come to fetch me, full
of life and spirit, to dine in the Palais Royal
with a party of friends, to talk over the proposition
of a law of succession, which he had had for some
time under consideration, and which it was his intention
to present to the National Assembly. We
walked together from my lodgings to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">restaurateur</i>
Robert’s, where dinner had been ordered.
I thought, in the conversation concerning his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">projet de loi</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">226</a></span>
that Mirabeau was somewhat more depressed
than usual, and that his words came less
freely and less flowing from his tongue. He certainly
did complain of oppression and pain in his
head, and, although the evening was far from
sultry, he walked without his hat. I was particularly
struck with the lassitude and weariness
which he seemed to experience when we had arrived
at our destination, and which could not be
accounted for by our short slow walk from the Rue
St. Honoré. He flung himself listlessly upon one
of the benches beside the fountain in the middle
of the garden of the Palais Royal, and said, sadly,
that he was well pleased that our friends had not
yet arrived at the rendezvous, for he was desirous
of having a few moments’ private conversation with
me, not, for once, about public affairs, but concerning
his own. “Is it not strange,” said he,
“that I, who am about to present to the Assembly
a law, and to pronounce a speech, the result of long
study, upon wills, should never during my whole
life, have given one single thought to the making
of my own? Do you not think that it’s growing high
time to think of <em>every possibility</em>, with such strange
proceedings going on around us—eh, my friend?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
“‘I was surprised at this sudden revolution in
Mirabeau, for, of all men on earth, he had ever
been one of the most thoughtless as to the future,
caring little indeed even for the present, living <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">au
jour le jour</i>, heeding not if the morrow never came;
and I could only attribute his unwonted <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">accablement</i>
to over-exertion and fatigue. He had spoken
much in the Assembly, and had, I well knew, passed
many nights of late in the framing and preparation
of other acts and decrees, to be brought forward
before the close of the session.</p>

<p>“‘I tried to cheer him with soothing words, and
told him it was likely that his day for thinking of
this sort of thing was yet far off; that it was a mere
fit of depression which caused him to dwell upon
such gloomy possibilities; and I ventured to assure
him that a good dinner and a glass of our friend
Robert’s best Chambertin would soon produce a
good effect in calming his sudden misgivings about
the future.</p>

<p>“‘He shook his head mournfully: “These are
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">banal</i> phrases, and you know it,” said he; “they
are unworthy of you. I am neither a child nor a
woman, and fear not to listen to the whispering
voice of my own soul. The truth is, I <em>do</em> feel, at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>
this moment, most singularly overcome by a sadness
hitherto unknown—as if my task being, as it
were, but just begun, needed no longer my exertions
to finish it.” He laid his hand upon my knee, and
looked in my face, wherein must have been expressed
some anxiety, for I knew not what to think
of the mood in which I beheld him, and added
gently, “Should anything happen to me before
long, you will think of what I have been saying.”</p>

<p>“His voice was so altered, and his countenance
so drawn, that I became moved with sympathy, and
began to fancy that he really felt very ill, but, with
an <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">amour propre</i>, which, however misplaced on
such an occasion, would still have been compatible
with his character, I thought he might have been
concealing his state until he could no longer bear
up against it. I now listened, in mingled pity and
interest, while he explained to me many of his intentions
regarding the disposal of his property, in
case he should die without a written testament.
The education of his natural son, and the proper
disposal of his papers, were the subjects upon
which he displayed the most concern. He had
already taken the precaution to have the greater
part of his documents of importance conveyed to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">229</a></span>
trusty friend in Holland, and but few of those
which remained in France were in his own house.
He told me where these few were concealed, and
bade me to take charge of them, “In case,” he
always would repeat, “that anything <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fâcheux</i> (that
was his word) should befal him.”</p>

<p>“‘He then spoke long and earnestly about his
political career. In the single hour that we passed
thus seated side by side, amid the hurry and bustle
of the crowds who were hastening on all sides to
the different <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">restaurateurs</i> beneath the galleries,
did we converse together upon the splendid past,
the exciting present, and the <span class="smcap smaller">TERRIFIC FUTURE</span>.
We spoke in earnest whispers, pre-occupied and
abstracted from all around, as though we had been
conspirators in the bosom of some forest solitude.
The whole scene—the day—the hour, I can conjure
up in colours fresh and vivid, as though they had
vanished but one moment ago, and nothing else
had been impressed on the canvas of my memory
during all the long years since!’</p>

<p>“I have seldom, very seldom indeed, beheld
Prince Talleyrand give way to any demonstration
of feeling, even when cause sufficient may have
been found in some particular event going on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span>
around him. Perhaps, indeed, I may say that I
never saw him betray anything like emotion, excepting
on the occasion of this reminiscence of
Mirabeau. But he had taught himself from his
youth up to subdue speedily all outward display of
his inward feeling, and he resumed, in his own
subdued manner:</p>

<p>“‘It will surprise you when I tell you that
scarcely a day passes, even now, that I do not
call to mind that scene: in fact, it is often forced
upon me by the occurrences which are continually
taking place before my eyes. It was a cunning
device of the ancient seers to affirm that the gift
of prophecy might sometimes fall on men about to
die. It is not thus; but the words of those we
loved are garnered up, when they who perhaps had
spoken them many times before unheeded, can
speak them no more, and we remember them as
something new, although ’tis likely we may have
heard them oft and oft before.</p>

<p>“‘Mirabeau had doubtless many times, as upon
this occasion, held forth to me his fears and doubts,
his hopes and his despair, but I remember it not.
I can find place in memory for but this one interview,
and I have treasured up each word and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span>
phrase with a jealous vigilance, as though they had
been uttered during the brief visit of a spirit. I
had never been thoroughly inspired with the conviction
of the Herculean powers of the man until
this conversation. He seemed to toy with difficulties;
nothing was beyond his grasp; nothing
beyond the power of his will to bend. There is
scarcely a single <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">prévision</i> of his which time has
not realized, and often am I startled even now at
events, which, seemingly the consequence of yesterday,
had been foretold by him that evening, beside
the fountain in the Palais Royal. He gave me
many kind admonitions and warnings against some
who were in our intimacy, and whom he deemed
unworthy of friendship. He counselled me respecting
the path that I should take in case this
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">quelque chose de fâcheux</i>, which seemed to haunt
him so strangely, should take place, while affairs
were in such a troubled state. In every case did I
follow this advice, and in every case had I cause
to rejoice that I had done so. Mirabeau was certainly
inspired on that evening—he was sublime.
I remember being struck with a saying of his,
which I have since found of the greatest value.
After having traced out for me a plan of conduct,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">232</a></span>
in case public events should take the turn which
he was anticipating, he concluded by saying,
solemnly, “But, above all things, my friend, slight
not public opinion. Listen with open ears to the
public clamour—for remember that the voice of
the people is the <span class="smcap">voice of God</span>!”</p>

<p>“‘It was thus we conversed for more than an
hour, during which I learned more of Mirabeau
than I had done during the many years of strict
friendship in which we had lived together. I
should have regretted him far less, had this confidence
never taken place, for I should less have
learned to estimate his stupendous intellect, and
the grandeur of his mighty heart. As you may
suppose, I could have listened, entranced as I
was, until midnight, and was angry when Condorcet,
who was of our party, came running gaily
up to our bench, and seated himself beside us,
with a loud exclamation of surprise at the unusual
gravity of our demeanour. Of course the spell was
broken at once, and the conversation became general.
Soon afterwards, our two other friends joined
us, and we adjourned to Robert’s, at that time the
first <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">restaurateur</i> in Paris, where we found dinner
waiting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>
“‘The dinner was gay enough. I alone, of all
the company, was sad, and spoke but little. Mirabeau,
at first absorbed and pre-occupied, gradually
yielding to the influence which he never could
resist, that of wine and good fellowship, by degrees
shook off the recollection of the colloquy we
had had together so short a time before, and became
as usual the light and life of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">réunion</i>.
It would be a hopeless task to endeavour to recal
one tithe of all the brilliant sayings, the startling
epigrams, uttered by Mirabeau during this his last
flash of existence. I had never beheld him so excited,
so madly gay. He drank largely, and the
wine seemed to inflame his blood until his excitement
bordered on delirium. He raved—he sang—he
spoke in loud harangues—he laughed fiercely
at us all—at the court, at the people, at himself,
in short, at everything; and our companions hailed
with loud shouts and applause every <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bon mot</i> that
he uttered. I alone could not share in this strange
mirth, for I was yet shaken by the solemn foreboding,
the dismal presentiment with which he had
inspired me.</p>

<p>“‘At about four o’clock in the morning, the
spirit, no longer to be controlled even by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>
gigantic physical strength which he possessed, gave
way at last. He complained that his head felt
heavy, and said that the daylight, which was just
beginning to peep in from the window opposite,
fatigued his sight. Coffee was then proposed before
we parted, and Mirabeau eagerly took a cup,
which he himself poured out and sweetened. His
hand trembled violently as he raised it to his lips,
and he had scarcely replaced the cup upon the
table when he fell forward with his head upon his
hands, exclaiming, “My God! what strange new
pain is this?”</p>

<p>“‘He rallied again, however, presently, and bade
the waiter fetch a coach instantly, saying that he
foresaw an attack of spasms in the chest, and that
he knew his remedy, which was a hot bath and fumigations
as quickly as possible. He requested me
alone to accompany him, and from that moment
until his death I never left his side. We drove to
the public baths on the Boulevard, opposite to the
street where Mirabeau then lived, the Rue de la
Chaussée d’Antin. Here his sufferings increased
to such a frightful degree that I sent for Cabanis,
who, however, did not arrive until the patient had
left the bath, after having taken, against my most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">235</a></span>
earnest desire, a large bowl of milk and cocoa, of
which he was extremely fond. Strange to say, he
was considerably better after this, and left the bath
for his own house, <em>on foot</em>. It is this circumstance,
I have no doubt, which has given consistency to
the belief that he had been <em>poisoned</em>, as it is
averred that, had the mess of milk not been absorbed
as <em>antidote</em>, Mirabeau must, in the state in
which he was at the time, have died immediately
on taking it. Such sweeping reasoning as this is
of course beneath comment.</p>

<p>“‘It was with some difficulty that he could be
prevailed upon to go to bed. He resisted to the
last, declaring that the bright morning sun, which
by this time was streaming in glory through his
windows, would renovate him better than any physician’s
advice. Soon after he had lain down,
however, a change, from which he never rallied,
came over him, and he continued to get worse until
he died. It was a dreadful sight to behold his face,
all swollen and bloated, and speckled with livid
spots, and the white foam which gathered upon his
lips as fast as his attendants could wipe it away.
It certainly should not have been made a public
show, which, before the end of the day, the death-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">236</a></span>bed
of poor Mirabeau had become. Those foul
suspicions of treachery and poison had their origin,
I doubt not, in the extraordinary symptoms which
his disease presented.</p>

<p>“‘Never from the first instant did Mirabeau
deceive himself, or shrink from the decree. It has
never been my lot to witness a death so dignified,
so sublime. In the morning, through the day, surrounded
by friends and admirers, all was well; but
then came the silent watches of the night, when
his whole heart was bared to me, his only comforter.
Not once did he swerve, neither did he
throw back one single look of regret over the road
which he had for so many years been travelling.
Quite the contrary;—he met the grim enemy with
a courage and equanimity of temper, the gift of a
philosophy of the highest order.</p>

<p>“‘If popularity could have satisfied the soul of
Mirabeau, he surely must have died content. His
house was besieged, and, from the moment he was
declared to be in danger, the very street became
impassable from the crowd of messengers who
thronged his door. High and low, rich and poor,
felt alike an interest in the fate of the great man
who was to protect them between monarchy and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span>
anarchy, which it is certain the mighty intellect of
Mirabeau would have made an easy task.</p>

<p>“‘He lingered thus in pain and agony during
the whole of this day and night, and died in my
arms on the following morning at eight o’clock,
having preserved his firmness of intellect until the
very last moment. It <em>is</em> true (for there were some
absurd stories afloat) that, about five minutes
before he actually expired, he wrote on a piece of
paper (for speech was already gone) these words:
“<em>It is far easier to die than to sleep!</em>” The
movement which he made to place the paper in
my hand was his last. He never stirred afterwards.
I have kept that precious scrap of writing
through every change of fortune; and in the hope
of keeping it to my dying day, have taken measures
to have it preserved when I shall be no more.
During his illness, he frequently reverted to the
conversation which had passed between us on the
bench at the Palais Royal. He told me that he
then already <em>knew</em> that his fate was sealed, and
dared me to maintain a conviction of the contrary.
Throughout my whole life, I have ever resisted
superstitious feeling, but there certainly does seem
something strange and unaccountable in this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">238</a></span>
gloomy foreboding of Mirabeau, that gives the
lie direct to all one’s predetermined disbelief in
the doctrine of “presentiments.”</p>

<p>“‘The generation of to-day, contrary to anticipation,
has learnt to undervalue Mirabeau; but I
think a re-action may come even in your time, because
he was not a mere orator, whose fame must
die when his powers of speech are gone, but he was
also the greatest thinker of his age. How would
the face of the country have been changed had he
lived but a few months, nay, even a few weeks
longer! This has been so strongly felt by all
parties, that there were many who blindly <em>rejoiced</em>
at his death, even among those who had known
and loved him; while those who had most cause
to mourn, declared, in their terror, that he must
have been poisoned.</p>

<p>“‘I have told you all the facts connected with
his illness and his death, and with me you will
cease to feel astonishment that the suspicion of
such a crime should have gone abroad, when you
consider the suddenness of his illness, its short
duration, and the dreadful sufferings amid which
his life was closed. These must have been terrific;
for, about an hour before his death, he turned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span>
angrily round to Cabanis, and said, ‘A physician
who is a true friend to the patient would not hesitate
at giving a dose of opium strong enough to quiet
such pain as this for ever.’ And yet, so powerful
was the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">morale</i> of the man, that even when thus
writhing in agony, he could not refrain from laughing
most heartily at some popular <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">lazzis</i> which were
bandying between a screaming <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ecaillière</i> and the
lackey of some person of quality, who were contending
for the first hearing of the bulletin of the
past night, and which reached his ear through the
open window looking on the court-yard below.</p>

<p>“‘The public grief at the death of Mirabeau
told more for his worth and greatness than whole
volumes of written eulogium could now do. Perhaps
there never before was an example of a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chef de
parti</i> having been mourned as sincerely by the
adverse party as by his own. The court was in
consternation; the queen concealed not her despair,
for she foresaw the dread consequence; the
last barrier between the furious people and the
angry <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">noblesse</i> was down, and the bitter tide would,
ere long, rush in through the breach which the
falling of this goodly corner-stone had made. I
myself was so overcome by regret at the sudden<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span>
loss which I had sustained, that I retired for some
little time to Auteuil, scarcely daring to look at the
future, or to speculate for an instant upon what was
next to happen.’</p>

<p>“Such,” said C., “is the account given of the
death of Mirabeau, by one who was with him from
the moment of his first being seized with illness to
that when the troublous scene closed for ever. The
history contains, perhaps, as fine a moral lesson as
ever was preached from pulpit-desk or read in
school.</p>

<p>“The sentiment which subsisted between Sièyes
and the prince was of a different nature. There
might have existed, in the origin, some little feeling
of jealousy between them; it is certain they never
were free from the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">esprit de critique</i> indicative of
rivalry, either secret or avowed. On no one subject
did they differ more than on the subject of Mirabeau,
Sièyes refusing him the mighty powers that
the prince loved to allow him; and I have been
witness to long and severe discussions on this one
topic alone.</p>

<p>The prince was fond of telling a story <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à propos</i>
of Sièyes, illustrative of the theory of great results
from little causes. He was one day walking with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>
him through the Tuileries, when, just opposite to
the gate in the Place de la Concorde, a little beggar
girl, leading an old woman on crutches, came up
to solicit alms. Sièyes gave her a sou, which, in
her hurry to seize, she let fall, and the coin rolled
under the hoofs of the charger mounted by the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">garde du corps</i> on duty at the gate. The child
pressed forward to pick it up, but each time that
she stooped, almost at the risk of her life, the
soldier, apparently glad to divert the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ennui</i> of
sentry by an event of this kind, spurred the animal
to one side, and the wretched little girl, to avoid
being crushed to death, was compelled to withdraw,
to renew her endeavours again as soon as the beast
stood still, but each time with as little success as
before. The whole scene—the terror of the child—the
overboiling wrath of the old cripple, and the
insolent and cruel mirth of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">garde du corps</i>,
presented altogether a most exciting spectacle, and,
combined with the angry passions of the crowd,
who were not slow to take the part of the child,
formed a picture not easily forgotten.</p>

<p>“Sièyes, finding that the people were growing
angry, thought it best to put an end to the scene at
once; so, giving the girl a double sou, he bade her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span>
begone, which injunction she immediately obeyed,
and the crowd forthwith dispersed. But Sièyes
remained thoughtful and pre-occupied during the
whole evening; and, when he parted with his friend,
he said, ‘I have been thinking over the occurrence
we witnessed together this morning. Something
must be done for the people. <em>When they have an
army of their own</em>, they will not run the risk of
being insulted by hired mercenaries.’</p>

<p>“This was the very first idea which had ever
entered human brain respecting the formation of a
national guard. Once started, the idea found favour
with all the disaffected. Sièyes himself planned and
invented the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">projet</i>, and, by dint of perseverance,
got it accepted some long time afterwards. Little
did the proud <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Garde Nationale</i>, when they marched
to the frontier—when they dictated laws to the
country—when they barricaded Paris—dream that
they owed their existence and creation to a halfpenny
which a starving beggar wench found it
hard to pick out of the gutter!</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Apropos</i> of this story, there is an addition to
it which the prince always gives us, and which you,
who are come of a superstitious race, and plead
guilty to the accusation of superstition yourself,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">243</a></span>
will perhaps like to hear. M. de Talleyrand had
taken peculiar notice of the soldier who bestrode
the charger. He was a remarkably handsome
youth, quite an exquisite, an <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">incroyable</i>, with coal-black
moustaches and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">royale</i>, and snow-white
powdered hair,—a combination that certainly gives
a piquant expression to the countenance, which all
the fine chestnut hair or raven locks in the world,
however redundant, however silky, can never impart.
Besides, it suited so well with the costume of
the period, that it would seem as if the one had been
invented on purpose to show off the other. However,
to my story. You may well imagine that the
old cripple had not left the spot, however well satisfied
she might be with the unexpected generosity
of Sièyes, without loading the air with curses upon
the head of the young <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">garde du corps</i>. She was a
filthy hag, blear-eyed, and lame; and it was fearful
to hear her, as she tossed her rags aloft upon the
wind, utter such awful maledictions, in a screaming,
discordant voice, that the blood ran cold to listen.
The soldier sat in calm defiance on his saddle, in
the prettiest attitude imaginable. Stiff, starched,
on duty, without moving a muscle, with his hat on
one side, and his hand bent, and resting on his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>
thigh, he looked straight at the woman, for fear of
being suspected of wishing to shun her gaze; but
he betrayed no heed of her words, save by a slight
smile, which curled his lip, whereon rested a green
leaf (as was the fashion among the bucks of that
day), to keep it moist, and prevent its cracking by
exposure to the sun.</p>

<p>“The old witch, enraged at finding that her words
produced no greater effect, at length raised her
crutch in the young man’s face, and shrieked a
fearful malison. ‘Proud as you are, jackanapes, I
shall live to see your soul in h—, and your body
devoured by the dogs!’ With this, she hobbled
away, and we also turned aside in disgust, while
the young man remained immovable and unconcerned,
as though the words had not been addressed
to him at all.</p>

<p>“The event I have been relating took place
before the breaking out of the revolution. Now
rejoice, and listen, thou northern believer in prophecy
and witches. The very day after the return
of the king and queen from Versailles, when traversing
the Place Louis Quinze, M. de Talleyrand
was attracted by a crowd gathered round one of
the deep fossés, by which the place is intersected,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">245</a></span>
and, on going up, there beheld the body of the
unhappy <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">garde-du-corps</i>, lying all mangled and
bloody at the bottom. Some men belonging to the
police were endeavouring to catch at the corpse
with hooks, in order to drag it to the surface; and,
as they did so, it was discovered that a great part
of the throat and breast had been gnawed away by
starving dogs during the night. The poor lad had
been doubtless murdered by some unknown hand
during the bustle and confusion of the previous
day, and thrown into this convenient place, and
thus was the prophecy fulfilled.”</p>

<p>C. rose as he finished his story, and gazing
around, said, laughingly, “See you now the misfortune
of having to do with professed story-tellers?
We began with the history of this unfinished hunting
seat, and have paused at the beginning of the
French Revolution!”</p>

<p>“I need not lose by the delay, however,” said I;
“you can tell me the tale of this ruin as we go
home.”</p>

<p>“I remember,” replied C., “the sight of the
building brought to mind the subject, which has
formed a study of mine ever since I have been
with the prince—his powerful and varied influence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">246</a></span>
with all who approach him—and it was thus that I
was led into this long digression. This building,
which you now see so ruined and degraded, was
intended to have been one of the most remarkable
objects of the whole country round. It was
planned and designed by the late Princess T——,
as a surprise and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">galanterie</i> for the prince, who had
once, when taking a drive in her company, expressed
an opinion that this would be a good site
for a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">maison de plaisance</i>. The princess said
nothing in reply, but immediately on her return to
the château, despatched a courier with letters to
Chateauroux, containing orders for architects, surveyors,
masons, and all the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">attirail</i> of building, to
be sent immediately to the spot; and, in less time
than you can well imagine, the foundations of a
goodly-sized building, with courts and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">dépendances</i>,
befitting the residence of a repose-seeking
prince, were erected. Expense was to be considered
nought—despatch everything—workmen
were to be employed night and day until the
edifice was completed. All this was, moreover, to
be kept a profound secret until the building was
quite ready to inhabit, when the princess proposed
leading the company at the château through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">247</a></span>
wood to the spot, and then, enjoying their surprise,
to request their attendance at a ball and collation
of her own providing, in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">maison de plaisance</i>,
‘which she had built as a present to the Prince de
Talleyrand.’</p>

<p>“Meanwhile the prince, being again abroad with
the princess on another fine day—in quite an opposite
direction, almost drove her mad, by suddenly
stopping to admire another view. ‘Of all places
in the wood, this is the exact spot I should choose,
were I consulted, to erect a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">maison de plaisance</i>!’
said he.</p>

<p>“The princess was glad to hear this in time,
although it gave her great trouble and caused immense
outlay; however, she consoled herself with
the hope that she should succeed at last in delighting
the prince. She immediately gave orders for
the transport of the workmen and materials to this
new ‘Folie,’ and once more did the hammer and
saw resound through the silent wood, and again
did the grinding cart-wheels disturb another solitude.
Scarcely, however, were the foundations of
this second pavilion laid, when the prince again
disconcerted all the plans of the poor princess, by
exclaiming one day after dinner, ‘I drove this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">248</a></span>
morning by the river side—what a beautiful <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">point-de-vue</i>
there is down by the Willows; most assuredly
if I ever built a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">maison de plaisance</i>, that
is the spot I should choose.’</p>

<p>“This was too much. The princess was completely
overcome. She burst into tears, and left
the table, much to the astonishment of the company.
Nothing could persuade her that the allusion was
not wilful on the part of the prince, and she was in
actual despair of being able to please him. She
regretted not the large sums which she had expended,
and which had already grown serious, but
only the misfortune under which she had laboured
in not having chosen the right spot. The prince
laughed heartily at the joke, and, during the whole
of that season, his favourite promenade was to the
hill upon which the magnificent, unfinished Folie
Princesse remains a memento of the devotion of
her highness, and of her inability to give satisfaction.</p>

<p>“This lady was one of the ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">illustrations</i>’ of
Valençay, and her death has caused an immense
vacuum in our circle. Both by birth and marriage
allied to many of the sovereign families of Europe—with
a colossal fortune—with the tradition and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span>
remains of great beauty—she gave up even her
own identity, to become a mere part and parcel of
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">apanage</i> of the Prince de Talleyrand, content
to live in his shadow, and to borrow her importance
from him alone. There was a great deal that was
touching, from its total disinterestedness, amid all
the absurdity of this romantic devotion.</p>

<p>“The prince was often annoyed by the extent
to which she carried this <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">culte</i>, but, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en homme
d’esprit</i>, he generally succeeded in throwing back
the ridicule, which he felt was likely to attach to
him, upon herself, and scrupled not to enliven the
dulness of the evening circle by drawing her out;
while she, poor soul, too happy to occupy his attention
even for an instant, consented willingly to
become his butt; and thus it often happened that
the Princess T——, daughter, widow, and sister of
princes and heroes, was employed to divert the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ennui</i> of many a little <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">gentilhomme campagnard</i>,
or <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hobereau de province</i>, who might, as matter of
form and neighbourly feeling, chance to be invited
to dine at the château. But, as I tell you, although
perfectly aware of this—for she was by no means
wanting in penetration—she cared not so that ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ce
cher prince</i>’ found amusement; indeed, I think<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span>
she even felt honoured by the preference accorded
to her above the other guests.</p>

<p>“However, she failed not upon other occasions
to avenge herself upon these witnesses of her discomfiture,
and in her turn crushed without pity
every one around her who was not the ‘prince,’
or allied in some way with him, or one whom he
delighted to honour. With others, never was there
a more <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rogue et fière Allemande</i>, and in spite of
her good nature and generosity, she had more
enemies than many who sought less applause.</p>

<p>“She was the most eccentric person I ever met
with; the last of a race of which it will be impossible,
from the change in human ideas, ever to behold
another specimen. In her youth she had
been most beautiful, and still retained, saving the
loss of an eye, traces of loveliness even in advanced
age. She could not be called either clever or
witty, but was the cause of such interminable wit
in others, of such endless good sayings on the part
of the prince, that Valençay, to those who were
accustomed to her society, seemed dull <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à périr</i>
when she was not there. She had the greatest fund
of originality and natural vivacity that could be
possessed by any human being. Her ideas could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">251</a></span>
not be made, by any force of reasoning or persuasion,
to follow the tide of improvement of the
times, and she could never be taught to believe
that the revolution had wrought any change in the
relative positions of the aristocracy and the people,
but continued, to the latest period of her life, to
treat all plebeians and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">roturiers</i> as though they had
still been serfs and vassals, subject at her will and
pleasure to <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">détresse</i> and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corvée</i>. She was an invaluable
specimen of the old insolent noblesse; and after
a day spent in her company, you might retire to rest,
no longer wondering at the horrors of the great
revolution, nor yet at the hatred by which they had
been instigated.</p>

<p>On one occasion, she had nearly set the whole
province in an uproar by an unseasonable display
of what the prince was wont to call her <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">impertinence
Régence</i>. A large party had been invited
to dinner at the château, a party in honour of the
arrival of some high and illustrious visitor at Valençay;
I think there were even scions of royalty
among the guests. In short, it was one of the
gaudy days of the castle, when the flaming yellow
liveries, and the antique silver, and the royal gifts,
were all displayed. Of course the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">préfet</i> of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span>
department, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">maire</i> of Valençay, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">curé</i>, and,
in short, all the authorities of the place had been
invited, and with true provincial punctuality had
arrived at the exact hour named in the invitation,
which, as usual in modern times, was long before
the princely host expected to receive his guests;
and, when they were ushered into the drawing-room,
they found that none of the family had as
yet appeared, and that they would be consequently
compelled to amuse themselves as they best could
until the ringing of the bell, which would gather
together the stray members of the household.</p>

<p>“In a short time, however, the great doors of the
drawing-room were thrown back with a loud <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fracas</i>,
and in sailed, in all the majesty of stiffened silks
and fluttering plumes, her highness the Princess
T——. The troubled provincials immediately
with one accord turned from the chimney, where
they had been talking in mysterious murmurs concerning
the mighty individuals whom they were to
meet at dinner, and moved in a body with sundry
low bows, and a great display of gymnastic prostrations,
towards the fair princess. The latter
stood for a moment, and gazed as they advanced,
then turning suddenly round to the grinning domestic,
who had remained standing at the door:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">253</a></span>
“‘Fool!’ exclaimed she, indignantly, ‘did I not
bid you ascertain if anybody had arrived, before
I troubled myself to come down to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i>?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, princesse, and I came myself to see,’
answered the servant, looking rather puzzled and
embarrassed, first at his mistress, then at the guests,
who stood wondering where the questioning would
lead to, ‘and when I found these gentlemen
here, I——’</p>

<p>“‘Idiot!’ interrupted the princess, ‘not to know
your business better; remember that such as these
are not anybody, but <span class="smcap smaller">NOBODY</span>.’</p>

<p>“With these words she tossed out of the room,
pointing with her fan over her shoulder at the poor
stupified provincials, whose rage and mortification
defy description. They were not slow to spread
the tale of her insolence and haughtiness throughout
the country round, and the circumstance caused
the princess to be viewed with no very friendly eye,
as you may well imagine.</p>

<p>“Soon after this occurrence, having occasion to
visit Paris, she left Valençay in her carriage, drawn
by four horses, and driven by the postmaster himself.
Her highness was always in a most tremendous
hurry, and loved to be driven at a tremendous
rate. This the postmaster knew well, as he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">254</a></span>
been in the habit of driving her for years. He accordingly
took much pains upon the occasion to
which I refer, to go as slowly as possible, in order
to vex and worry the princess, whose temper was
not long in breaking forth, and she presently began
by calling after the driver in the most imperious
manner to hasten his speed. This injunction not
being attended to with as much alacrity as she
could have wished, she began to pour forth volleys
of abuse, seasoned with sundry fierce sounding
exclamations and oaths in the Polish language, to
which, upon great occasions like the present, she
was wont to give utterance, (according to her own
account, quite unconsciously.) The man bore this
for some little time, perhaps rather more diverted than
otherwise at the thought of the trick he was playing
one of those ‘infernal aristocrats;’ until at length,
no longer able to contain her indignation, the
princess seized the footstool which was at the
bottom of the carriage, and hurled it at the postillion,
with such unsteady aim however, that the
missile flew far above his head. ‘Dolt!’ shouted
she, standing upright in the carriage, and gesticulating
fiercely, ‘do you imagine you are carrying a
load of manure to market?’ ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ma foi!</i>’ exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span>
the postmaster, coolly dismounting from the saddle,
‘many’s the load of manure I’ve taken which has
fetched at market twenty times more than you
would have done there!’ With these words, he
deliberately set about unharnessing the horses from
the carriage, and bidding the other postillion do
likewise, he turned back towards Valençay, leaving
the carriage standing alone in the midst of the long
solitary road, with not a human habitation in sight
and night coming on. The shrieks and menaces
of the lady were all in vain; the man having paused
to light his pipe, with the greatest <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sang froid</i>,
jogged by the carriage window, cracking his whip
with fiendish enjoyment of her terror, until he got to
the very bottom of the hill, and was lost sight of. The
princess could never be prevailed upon to tell the
sequel of the story, nor of the means by which she
had been extricated from her most mortifying
situation; and, as neither of her tall valets nor her
talkative maids could ever be induced to betray the
secret, it was thought that she had compelled them
all four to turn out into the road and drag the carriage
to some wayside ale-house, where she could rest
till horses arrived. I know not if this was the
case, but she certainly was quite capable of doing it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">256</a></span>
“A goodly volume might be filled with her
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">naïvetés</i> and unconscious witticisms; for it was her
total indifference to the good things that she uttered,
and her contempt for the effect which they
produced, that constituted their greatest charm.</p>

<p>“I shall never forget the effect produced in the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i> one evening by an event which occurred a
short time before the prince’s embassy to London,
and which served to <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">égayer</i> the society for some
time. Among other ancient traditions of the
courtly life of former days which she loved to keep
up, and one, too, which completely coincided with
her tastes and habits, was the custom of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">petit
billet</i>, a usage which has been completely lost
since the time of the great revolution, and which
might be taken as a specimen of the time-killing,
fiddle-faddle occupations in which the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">noblesse</i> of
that day passed their lives.</p>

<p>“This custom of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">petit billet</i> still exists in
many of the old families wherein courtesy and
etiquette are still maintained, at least among the
elder members. It consisted in writing a short
note of inquiry every morning to the person beloved,
who answered it likewise in writing, for no
verbal message would have been received. Of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">257</a></span>
course the contents of the note could not be much
varied. There could be nothing to say but day
after day the same ‘good morrow,’ with inquiries
how the night had been passed, and other questions
of small interest, which the present generation,
who live deep and fast, expending their sentiments
and energies on greater things, have no time to
make. I myself know a married couple of the old
school who, like all married couples of the old
(French) school, have been separated <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">de corps et
de biens</i> for the last forty years, and who have
never missed once during the whole of that time
sending the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">petit billet de matin</i>. I was once
thoughtless enough to rally the lady upon this
constancy, when she replied, angrily, ‘Monsieur,
although Monsieur le Comte and myself may not
choose to live together, yet our mutual position,
and the rank we both hold in society, prevent our
enjoying the privilege of dispensing with the common
customs and formalities of the circles in which
we have both been bred. In renouncing all idea
of love for each other, we have not renounced
good breeding.’</p>

<p>“Well, the princess, who was, as I tell you, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à cheval</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">258</a></span>
upon etiquette with regard to the prince,
never appeared in the morning without having
been preceded by her <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">petit billet</i>, although the
prince never thought fit to encourage her absurdity
by sending a written answer. One evening, she
had retired earlier than usual, and, shortly after,
just as the company was breaking up, a note was
handed to the prince by the princess’s valet. We
were all rather alarmed at first, fearing that she
might have been seized with illness; but presently
the billet was handed about amid roars of laughter;
there was nought to fear; it ran thus: ‘Cher
prince. How are you this morning? I myself
am far from well, having passed a wretched night,
although when I <em>did</em> sleep, I dreamed of you, which
was some little consolation amid all my agitation
and restlessness.’ The note bore the morrow’s
date, and had been given by the careless servant
some twelve or fourteen hours too soon! Upon
inquiry, it proved to be the habit of the princess to
write these little billets over night, to avoid being
disturbed in the morning; they were laid on her
toilet table, whence the valet had taken the one in
question, without inquiry and without reflection.
Of course the prince was merciless; the Princess<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">259</a></span>
de T—— furnished the standing joke of the season,
and was never left in peace until some new
absurdity caused the story of her ‘precautionary
measure’ to fade in the background.”</p>

<span class="subhead">RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY LIFE, BY PRINCE TALLEYRAND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“It is a most extraordinary circumstance,” said
I to C., one evening, as we sat together in the little
turret-chamber, “that no well-authenticated life of
the prince has ever been written. It would, I have
no doubt, attract more attention than any work of
the kind which has appeared for years. Why do
you not attempt the task? You are better qualified,
from the length of time you have been in
his intimacy, from your very admiration of the
man, to undertake the task, than any one else
now living.”</p>

<p>“You flatter me,” said C., smiling; “the undertaking
would be far beyond my power, or, indeed,
it would be within the limit of the capabilities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">261</a></span>
but of one man alone. The sole biographer of
Prince Talleyrand must be Prince Talleyrand
himself. Any clever, well-informed historian might
give the facts of the prince’s life, but who but himself
could render to posterity a satisfactory account
of the <em>motives</em> which had led to action, the <em>consequences</em>
which have accrued from the various
decisions which he has taken, and which, in most
instances, as he himself is always declaring, have
been totally in opposition to the results foreseen?
Such a biography of himself as <em>he</em> could write,
would be a literary monument as lasting as the
world itself. It would be the <em>secret</em> history of every
government of Europe for the last sixty years—the
private memoirs of every distinguished individual
would have to be incorporated into such a
biography, where, of necessity, every distinguished
individual in Europe <em>must</em> be made to play a part.
I know that M. de Talleyrand has been for years
past compiling his diplomatic memoirs, but, by a
singular infatuation, he has proclaimed his intention
of not permitting their publication to the world
until forty years after his death. This determination,
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à la</i> Voltaire, is singularly in accordance
with the character of the man, who is always repeating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">262</a></span>
so playfully, ‘No one can doubt my
powers of waiting.’</p>

<p>“Some of those most interested in the matter,
to whom he has communicated his malicious decision,
rail loudly against such a determination;
whilst others, with perhaps equally good reason, as
loudly applaud; so that it is evident to the unconcerned
looker-on, that whatever may be his secret
motive for thus deciding, it is already justified by
the different passions which it has excited. He
has in this, as in everything else, displayed the
depth of his reflective powers, and refused to sacrifice
high interests and grave results to a paltry
feeling of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">amour propre</i>. He has reflected that,
in those intervening years, all the loud baying
pack of fierce detractors of his fame will have
yelped forth their calumnies—the smaller fry will
also have all expended their puny efforts, and then
<em>he</em> will come and call upon posterity to judge between
him and them. Doubt it not—posterity will
answer the appeal. The next generation will be
more just than his own. The fierce passions, the
deadly struggles, the political hatreds, amid which
his own existence has been passed, will all have
died away, and men will sit in calm, unbiassed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">263</a></span>
judgment on the various actions of his life, and
will be the better able to pronounce their verdict
when they have beheld the <em>consequences</em> of
his counsels; when they shall have been enabled
to compare his adoration of his country, his indifference
to its <em>rulers</em>, with the slavish self-interest,
the narrow-minded, mercenary views of those with
whom he had so often to contend.</p>

<p>“Believe me, a man must entertain a tolerably
good opinion of his own discrimination, and have
the organ of self-esteem developed in no mean
degree, who could sit down coolly with a pretension
of giving to the world a correct, nay, even a
<em>lucid</em> life of Prince Talleyrand. He has out-lived
the greater portion of the comrades of his youth,
of whom even then he lived so far in advance,
that it was said of him, he had ‘comrades and
colleagues, but no contemporaries.’ Long before
middle age, he had learned that, in public life, the
one thing needful is discretion; while he it was
who first published to mankind the discovery he
had made, that ‘speech was given to man to conceal
his thoughts.’ Therefore, it is not probable
that there exists a soul who could ever have penetrated
sufficiently into the wily statesman’s confidence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">264</a></span>
ever to gain enough knowledge of his aims
and views, to <em>account</em> for the different changes in
his principles, with which he has been so taunted by
all parties. There is not a single epoch of his
life which is not, besides, so bound up with anecdotes
and incidents of the ‘times in which he
lived,’ that often the most simple recital of facts,
as connected with any adventure in which he may
have been engaged, might give deep offence in
other quarters, and cause recrimination, and perhaps
even, in some cases, litigation, on the part of
other high personages, whose names would have to
be brought forward.</p>

<p>“No man was ever made the object of so much
unjust vituperation as the Prince de Talleyrand, of
calumnies which have been accepted by the credulous
with as much good faith as proofs of holy
writ; while not one single <em>proof</em> of perfidy or
baseness has ever been brought against him—nothing
but supposition, for the most part ill-sustained,
and sometimes even completely belied by
his subsequent conduct. Notwithstanding the apparent
freedom with which he admitted all his
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">entourage</i> to his intimates, how little is really
known of his private life! Notwithstanding the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">265</a></span>
greediness with which the public have always
sucked in any stray anecdote, any fugitive <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bon mot</i>,
or axiom of this great man’s, yet how strangely
ignorant do they still remain of his real character—how
blind to the real grandeur of soul, which
he ever displayed amid the most trying circumstances—where
any other than he would have
clutched at the shadow, he let both the empty substance
and the emptier shadow pass, while he
calmly paused for that which was to follow. The
truth is this—the <em>mind</em> is made the judge of the
public character; the <em>heart</em> alone can understand
the value of the private one.</p>

<p>“I have often myself seen him smile at the
idea of any one attempting his biography, and,
whenever by chance he found himself compelled
to receive at Valençay any of the petty journalists,
the stray collectors of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bon mots</i> and epigrams for
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salons</i> of Paris, I have beheld him take a
malicious pleasure in mystifying their credulity by
relations of the most extravagant adventures connected
with himself, or with the great public men
with whom he had come in contact. One of his
keenest enjoyments consists in making me read,
while he is at his toilet, these same anecdotes as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">266</a></span>
they appear in the peculiar journal for which the
poor <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">gobe-mouche</i> has been catering. As I have
said before, there is so much that is real, and so
much that is false, mixed up with everything connected
with the prince, that the historian who
would seek to be veracious, finds himself completely
baffled. On the other hand, the world of
anecdote is our own. He is no niggard, in sooth,
of his rich store of souvenirs, and loves to dispense
them to his intimates with a bounteous hand. The
mention of an obscure name, the raising of the
simplest doubt, will draw forth, when he is in the
vein, such ample fund of amusement, that many a
thick, closely-printed volume might have been compiled
from this source alone.</p>

<p>“I remember that, one evening, by some unaccountable
circumstance which I now forget, we
were fated to spend the hours from dinner till bedtime
alone. The ladies of the family had gone to
do honour to the bridal of a rich vassal in the neighbourhood
of the château, and had most especially
recommended the prince to retire early, as he was
labouring under severe cold on the chest. You
will scarcely believe me when I tell you that we
remained up together until daylight—so absorbed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">267</a></span>
was he in the remembrance of events of years
gone by, and of which some simple observation
on my part had touched, as it were, the galvanic
train, and roused the reminiscences which
had slumbered perhaps since his youth, while I
thought not of rest or sleep so long as he talked
on. I could have listened until doomsday. One of
the subjects on which he spoke that evening was
the very one upon which I have just been entertaining
you; that of his memoirs. There had been
an advertisement in one of the Paris papers that
morning announcing sketches of ‘the Arch-Diplomatist,
from Original Documents.’</p>

<p>“‘This is about the fortieth attempt of the kind
within the last dozen years,’ said he, in answer to
my information of the circumstance, ‘and, what is
more astonishing is the fact, as I am told, of their
having all met with more or less success. The
public love to be duped, and seek with eagerness
every occasion to be deceived. It is the charlatans
alone whose numbers fail, dupes are never
wanting.’</p>

<p>“Had I not been already convinced of the utter
impossibility which must ever exist of any individual
of our day being able to do justice to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">268</a></span>
‘Life of Prince Talleyrand,’ that evening’s conversation,
in the old Perrault-looking drawing-room
of Valençay, would have amply proved it. A volume
might be filled with the anecdotes he told
me merely relating to the first years of his youth—just
at his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">début</i> in the fashionable world, before
the revolution. He began with the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Séminaire</i>, recounting
with peculiar delight the history of his
intimate associates there—his prodigious memory
seeming to grasp the most trifling details relating
to each with as much vigour and freshness as
though he were speaking of yesterday. Many
were the curious customs, the picturesque observances,
of the old place, the very tradition of
which has since been lost, obliterated, and trodden
under foot in the mire of the revolution, and of
which he alone, in the whole world, was left the
chronicler.</p>

<p>“‘It cannot be denied,’ said he, in speaking of
this establishment, ‘that vice and infidelity had
crept in there as elsewhere, as how could it be
otherwise, when all the talent and brilliancy which
have dazzled youth in all ages were on the side of
doubt and irreligion? And yet there were still
some bright examples, some few specimens of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">269</a></span>
higher order of beings, gathered among us, whose
light shone out yet brighter from amid the utter
darkness by which they were surrounded. The
histories of some of those young men would better
serve as themes for novel or romance than for book
of saintly lore; for the revolution dispersed them
right and left, and sent them forth to the world,
some to battle with their fierce, pent-up passions,
others to struggle with their timid fears.</p>

<p>“‘Not all the romance that ever was written
could equal in interest the plain narration of some
of the adventures which, in after life, befel my
fellow-students. Some perished beneath the revolutionary
axe, voluntary martyrs—others were
found in the ranks of Napoleon’s army, wearing
the epaulettes and moustaches of his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">avant garde</i>,
or caracoling among his voltigeurs. There still
live some few who occupy posts of honour and of
trust, which the government of Louis Dixhuit
bestowed in utter ignorance of antecedents, while
many of those who had mourned their bondage the
most bitterly, lived to regret it, with yearning for
the quiet which it yielded, and which they have lost
for ever.</p>

<p>“‘One of the most striking examples of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">270</a></span>
vanity of human wishes may be found in the history
of Eugène de B——, who had been my fellow
salver-bearer at the visit of the Bishop of Bordeaux
to St. Sulpice. This was considered an office of
honour, and bestowed upon the two best wranglers
of the season. My companion was one of the
handsomest young men I ever beheld; tall and
dark, with all the fire of the south in his black eye
and swarthy complexion, and the impress of high
descent stamped upon his features. He was the
natural son of a nobleman holding a high office
about the court, and might hope through this
channel to rise to the loftiest dignity and honour in
the church. It was not known who his mother was,
but it was whispered amongst us that she must have
been either Jewess or Bohemian—a belief to which
his singular eye and chiselled features gave rise.
He was of a proud, impassioned character, violent
and indomitable; one with whom his teachers and
those in authority were obliged to pause before
they ventured to rush into open warfare. Neither
penitence nor reprimand had ever been able to
tame his violent, irascible nature, and, on more
than one occasion, had it not been for the great
honour which his learning and acquirements conferred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">271</a></span>
on the establishment, he would have been
expelled.</p>

<p>“‘His fiery soul revolted at the idea of entering
the Church. I have seen him shudder with disgust
as he donned the black serge dress which denoted
his calling, and absolutely refuse to walk in his
rank in the processions, which, at certain festivals,
formed part of the ceremonies of the day. His
dreams were all of a military life and military
glory. He told me himself, that, proud as he was,
he had <em>knelt</em> to his father to beg him to suffer him
to embrace the profession of arms. He would have
been a Knight of Malta—a volunteer—even a
private soldier—anything, so long as he might be
permitted to follow the bent of his inclination, and
join the army; but his father had said coldly, that
his interest in the army was all swallowed up by
his other sons, and, besides, that he disapproved
greatly of this clashing of interests between young
men of the same name, who yet bore it under circumstances
so different; that he would not countenance
any change of profession; that he might
rely on his protection so long as he continued
obedient to his commands, and that a fortune, such
as would satisfy his most ardent ambition, awaited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">272</a></span>
him on the completion of his studies, if he would
remain content in the calling which his relatives
had chosen for him.</p>

<p>“‘From such reasoning there was no appeal, and
poor Eugène remained at the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Séminaire</i>, cursing
his fate, and nursing his bitterness against the
existing order of things, which thus left him helpless
and without defence, the slave of another’s will,
to follow the very calling he so much despised.
You will readily believe that, with these sentiments,
he was one of those who yielded the most readily
to the influence of the new doctrines which the
philosophers of that day had begun to preach with
so much success. He had frequently been severely
reprimanded, and sometimes even harshly punished
for his undisguised approval of the new tenets, for
among his class-fellows, he sought not to conceal
his sentiments, but proclaimed aloud his contempt
of the aristocracy, his hatred of the oppressors of
the people, his opinion that the king would one
day be taken to task for his weak administration;
and, above all, his tongue waged loudest war against
the queen, poor Marie Antoinette, ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Autrichienne</i>,’
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">l’étrangère</i>, the ‘cruel she-wolf,’ the heartless dissipator
of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">deniers du peuple</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">273</a></span>
“‘He left the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Séminaire</i> with these feelings still
existing; he was much younger than myself, and I
lost sight of him for some time; I only heard
accidentally that he had been appointed to serve one
of the chapels of Notre Dame, merely while awaiting
a vacancy to occur in some rich prebend or fat
abbaye, to which his father might have credit to
get him appointed. Meanwhile, the revolution broke
out, and Eugène stood free to take the path from
which he had been forcibly driven while dependent
on his father’s will. Of course, after what I knew
of his character, it did not in the least surprise me
to learn that he had thrown his frock <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">aux orties</i>, or
that he had chosen to enter the army; but what
really did surprise me to a great degree was the
astounding information which was given me by his
brother, the Marquis de B——, that he had attached
himself to the broken remnants of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">gardes-du-corps</i>;
that he had followed them most pertinaciously
as a volunteer; that he had twice been
severely wounded in defending the queen from
the fury of the mob; and that he was the individual
who had carried the dauphin, at the very
risk and peril of his life, across the Allée des
Feuillans, on the day of the memorable attack!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">274</a></span>
“‘And what became of him after this?’ inquired
I of his brother, already in my own mind anticipating
the answer, for there were but few of those
who had made themselves the least conspicuous in
the like manner who escaped.</p>

<p>“‘Why, he was of course arrested,’ replied the
marquis, ‘and thrown into prison, but was discharged
on suspicion of madness, although he was
no more mad than I am. He remained in Paris
without seeking concealment during the hottest
period of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">terreur</i>, and by a most extraordinary
chance, was suffered to go unharmed, doubtless
protected by the same suspicion of insanity. My
father and myself had joined the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">armée de Condé</i>,
and would then have been glad of the acquisition
of such a bold, brave spirit, to the cause. With the
view of his passing the frontier, we succeeded, by
dint of the greatest privations, in raising a sum of
money which we had conveyed to him. He thanked
us sincerely, but said <em>he could not desert his post
nor join us till his task was fulfilled</em>! With
alarm we heard of him again at the execution of
the queen, when he made himself remarkable by
his conduct at the scaffold. It appears that he
threw himself beneath the wheels of the cart in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">275</a></span>
which that unfortunate princess was transported to
her doom, and narrowly escaped being torn to
pieces by the infuriated <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poissardes</i> for his loud
and outrageous vituperations at their cruelty. He
escaped, however, by his extreme good fortune
once again, and we were once more appealed to
for money to “procure him a passage out of this
horrid country,” wrote he, “where neither innocence
nor beauty could find favour in the sight of men
more savage and cruel than the beasts of the field.”
He refused to tell us in what manner he had disposed
of the immense sum we had already, at
great risk and inconvenience, sent him for the same
purpose. Nevertheless, so great was our anxiety
for his safety, and so great the desire that was felt
throughout the whole <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">armée de Condé</i> for the acquisition
of so valuable a member to its ranks, that a
subscription was raised among us, poor as we were,
and once more was the sum required despatched to
this <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">enfant prodigue</i>, while we awaited in terror his
safe arrival.’</p>

<p>“The marquis paused in his narrative, and then
added, ‘And, from that hour to this, I have never
beheld him, although he was living, until lately,
not far from my own château in Bretagne.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">276</a></span>
“‘Why, then, came he not to join you?’ said I.
‘Did he escape from the country?’</p>

<p>“‘He did.’</p>

<p>“‘And what became of him after this?’</p>

<p>“‘He became a <span class="smcap smaller">MONK</span>!’ replied the marquis,
‘with the money we had raised at so much toil and
pains; he left the country and went to Italy, where
he entered a convent of Camuldules; but, after the
Restoration, finding the rules of this order not
severe enough, he returned to France, and entered
the monastery of La Trappe. It is but a few
months ago that I received a letter from the superior
of the convent, informing me of my brother’s
death, and mentioning that, although it was against
the regulations of the order to admit of the bequeathing
of any legacy to the laity, yet, in consideration
of the marvellous piety of brother
Eugène, he was willing to forward to me, according
to his dying wish, the bequest which he had
made me. This letter was accompanied by a small
sealed packet, which contained about a yard of
narrow black ribbon, and a receipt in due form for
a sum of money which I instantly remembered was
the exact amount despatched in the first instance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">277</a></span>
to my brother from the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">armée de Condé</i>! The
writing was in the hand of <em>Henri Samson, the
executioner</em>, signed by him, and bearing witness
that the money had been received on delivery to
the citizen Eugène B—— of the black ribbon
which had bound the forehead and held back the
hair of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">citoyenne</i> Capet on the morning of her
execution.</p>

<p>“‘It was all stained, and stiff with drops of
blood. There were a few lines hurriedly written
on the back of this paper by the hand of Eugène,
wherein he said that he wished not to leave behind
him the suspicion that he had disposed in an unworthy
manner of the money which we had had so
much difficulty in raising, and that he desired that
I should become possessor of this relic, and that
if possible, it should be preserved in the family
from generation to generation. He then merely
added that he felt sure, from the knowledge of my
sentiments, that I should cast no reproach upon
his memory for having spent the sum in the acquisition
of this treasure—this memorial of one, who,
from having been a martyr upon earth, was now a
saint in heaven.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">278</a></span>
“‘The marquis told me that he had immediately
despatched the ribbon to Gratz, deeming that the
relic would be most appreciated by the royal lady
who sits there in desolate grandeur to mourn the
fate of all whom she has loved in this world. He
showed me, however, the receipt, which is, perhaps,
one of the most extraordinary <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pièces justificatives</i>,
which could possibly be produced, and
would, I doubt not, readily find a purchaser at a
higher price than that for which it was given in acknowledgment.</p>

<p>“‘Such was the history of my fellow salver-bearer.
After a youth spent in burning vows, in
oaths and protestations of what would be his
achievements, should he ever be freed from that
sombre habit and that slavish tonsure—with a
heart beating high with courage, a soul burning for
honour and distinction, no sooner had he obtained
the freedom for which he had so long sighed, than
he hastened to bury all hope, ambition, and liberty
beneath the cowl and lowly gabardine of the Trappist.
It is evident that his boiling imagination
and ardent fancy had been struck with the charms
and matchless grace of Marie Antoinette as soon
as he had beheld her; he had nursed this passion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">279</a></span>
through years of sorrow and despair, and, when all
was over, had sought this solitude but to dwell undisturbed
with the memory of her whom he had
loved so long, and with devotion so true and yet so
hopeless.</p>

<p>“‘What a pity,’ said the prince, with a malicious
smile, as he concluded his story, ‘that your favourite,
Alexandre Dumas, or Eugène Sue, should
not have been apprised of the existence of my
poor comrade! What a fine five-act melodrama
or eight-volumed romance would have been drawn
from such materials, could either of them but have
procured an hour’s interview with him, even
through the famous hole in the garden-wall at
Meilleraye, by which I am told much knowledge
of the interior arrangements of the Trappists gets
abroad into the world.’</p>

<p>“M. de Talleyrand never will lose an opportunity
of giving a playful <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup de patte</i> to the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">romantiques</i>, whom, like all the followers of the
school of Voltaire, he holds in most especial aversion;
and many are the amicable battles which he
and I are in the habit of fighting together upon
this subject.”</p>

<p>“Do you ever meet any of the prince’s fellow-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">280</a></span>students
of Saint Sulpice at the Hôtel Talleyrand?”</p>

<p>“There is but one who frequents it,” replied C.;
“for in general it is they who rather shun the recollections
which the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ci-devant</i> Abbé de Perigord
must bear with him. <em>His</em> intercourse with them
has ever been frank and free. As he never played
the part of a hypocrite with them, so has he never
had to fear detection, or to dread an encounter
with those who could tell of his early life.</p>

<p>“There is something touching in the candour
and simplicity with which the prince will sometimes
converse of Saint Sulpice with the individual
to whom I now allude: the only one of his class-fellows
with whom he has maintained any degree
of intimacy, and whom he has bound to himself by
ties of the deepest gratitude. He is the Curé of
Saint Thomas, one of the most simple-hearted and
virtuous of men, and one whom, I think, it would
much surprise were he to be told that the Prince
de Talleyrand, in spite of his apostasy, had ever
been taxed with foul falsehood and black treason,
and all the other crimes which have been laid to
his charge by the hackneyed writers of the day.
In the eyes of the good man (and if ever there was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">281</a></span>
a saint upon earth, it is he), M. de Talleyrand
has never been guilty but of one fault, which he
qualifies by naming it a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tort</i>, when, in a misguided
moment, he left the Church for the allurements of
the world; but nothing, however, can persuade the
worthy curé that the prince would not have returned,
had he not been prevented by his marriage.
I know nothing more delightful than to listen to
the conversation of these two old friends, most
particularly when relating to the olden days, and
to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Séminaire</i>. The prince is really much attached
to M. D——; and I remember his being
highly incensed upon taking up a volume of some
of the modern spurious memoirs, wherein the old
curé was mentioned with ridicule, on account of
his extreme simplicity. He told me the true story
of the good man, which was there related in a
garbled form, and which he, who was at Saint
Sulpice at the time the adventure occurred, of
course remembered well, and told <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">con gusto</i>.</p>

<p>“It appears that the good curé, who all his life
has been remarkable for his childlike simplicity
and credulity, was known at the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Séminaire</i> by the
sobriquet of ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Providence</i>,’ which he had acquired
from his readiness to believe in the intervention of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">282</a></span>
Heaven, whenever the cause was a worthy one,
however trifling it might appear, to vain, weak
mortals like ourselves. He had risen one cold,
snowy morning in December, to attend early matins
at some church in the neighbourhood, and had
dressed himself stealthily and in darkness, fearing
to disturb his chum, M. de Sèze, who, worldling
as he was, snored on, heedless that it was one of
the most solemn festivals in all the year, the feast
of St. Nicolas. Meanwhile, the good youth stole
shivering down the stairs and through the gloomy
streets, clasping his breviary beneath his arm, and
repeating all the way most eloquent invocations to
Our Lady of the Burning Brand, the patroness of
charcoal burners, for a little of that warmth which
she bestows so liberally upon her votaries, to enable
him even to feel the beads of his rosary as he
passed them through his stiffened fingers.</p>

<p>“On arriving at the church-door, he was assailed,
or rather waylaid, by a poor woman, an old pensioner
of his, who rushed forward and fell at his
feet the moment he appeared, declaring that she
was a lost creature unless he came to her help;
that she had passed the whole night wandering in
the streets; that her landlord refused to give her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">283</a></span>
admittance to her lodging to take away her few
paltry rags, unless she paid him what was owing
for the rent, which she had no means of doing
unless through his bounty. Now it so happened
that the young <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Séminariste</i>, never overburdened
with the good things of this world, found himself
at that peculiar moment entirely <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à sec</i>, and was
awaiting his monthly allowance of pocket-money
before he could venture to make his appearance
among his poor pensioners, so boundless were his
charities, so great his nervous dread of being compelled
to refuse himself the pleasure of bestowing
relief upon the needy—the only pleasure, indeed,
which he ever allowed himself to enjoy—the only
way in which he suffered himself to expend the
scanty pittance which his aged mother could spare
from her poor income for procuring, as she imagined,
some few luxuries for her son.</p>

<p>“It was in vain, however, that the young abbé
endeavoured to assure the poor woman of his utter
inability to assist her this once. In vain he endeavoured
to shake her off—she clung to his knees—she
bathed his feet with her tears—she called on
the Lord to bless him, her tender benefactor—she
<em>knew</em> that he would relieve her—that he would not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">284</a></span>
have the heart to see her four poor fatherless
children turned into the streets to starve. What
was a miserable sum of three small crowns (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">petits
écus</i>) to such a noble gentleman? Why, he would
not miss such a paltry sum at night, were his pocket
picked of it before he returned home.</p>

<p>“‘But my good woman,’ said he, completely
overcome by her importunity, ‘rich as you think
me, I have not at this moment a single <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sou</i> in my
possession.’</p>

<p>“‘Nay, nay, feel in your pockets, monseigneur;
you will surely find enough to save me and my
helpless babes from starving. It is not much, my
lord bishop (for you will surely become one day a
bishop), only three poor crowns!’</p>

<p>“‘But on my word, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ma bonne amie</i>, I have it
not—were you to search my pockets through, I tell
you again, you would not find a single <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sou</i>.’</p>

<p>“‘Ay, that is ever the way,’ screamed the woman,
clinging to the skirt of his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">soutane</i>, which she held
fast in her grasp; ‘that is ever the way with rich
and noble gentlemen whose pockets are lined with
gold and silver—they never have a coin so small
as a single <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sou</i>—but search, in Heaven’s name,
and you will surely find my three poor crowns,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">285</a></span>
which are all that stand between me and perdition.’</p>

<p>“‘Nay, then, if you believe me not—see rather
if I tell not truth,’ said the poor lad, completely at
his wit’s end; and, as he said the words, he turned
the pockets of his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">soutane</i> inside out—when, what
was his surprise (oh, miracle!) out rolled upon the
ground three bran new silver small crowns, which
seemed to jingle with most heavenly music as they
fell at the feet of the poor mendicant, who, with a
shriek of joy, gathered them up, and rushed from
the church, before the thunderstruck abbé had as
yet recovered from the awe and wonder into which
the occurrence had thrown him. He remained for
some moments riveted to the spot in a sort of
beatified trance, unable to imagine it possible that
so great a miracle could have been vouchsafed to
so unworthy a sinner as himself. Once more he
plunged his hands eagerly into the pockets of his
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">soutane</i>—but no other coin was forthcoming. Yes—it
was evident—Providence had vouchsafed this
miracle by way of encouragement to his weak endeavours.
He put up an inward prayer for protection
against the sin of self-conceit, as the thought
overtook him, and, presently recovering himself,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">286</a></span>
he rushed to the altar of the Virgin, and breathed
forth his gratitude at her feet. So great was his
emotion, that he resolved at once to spend the
whole day in the church, in fasting and in prayer,
that no earthly sentiment might mingle with the
heavenly feeling thus awakened within him.</p>

<p>“The poor abbé was, indeed, so elevated with
the adventure, that he felt neither cold nor hunger,
but remained the whole day praying at the different
altars; nor did he suffer a morsel to pass his lips
until set of sun. He then returned to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Séminaire</i>
full of humility and gratitude, determined
not to tell his adventure to any of his comrades, in
dread of their unbelieving mockery. They were,
however, all abroad—for was it not the feast of
St. Nicolas, the gayest holiday in the year, the
festival of the patron saint of all the youths and
unmarried men in France; when even the poor
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Séminaristes</i> were allowed to spend the evening
outside the walls of Saint Sulpice—and they had,
of course, all taken advantage of the permission,
excepting M. de Sèze, who rushed down the stairs
in a perfect fury, as soon as the step of poor ‘Providence’
was heard; and, without a word of explanation,
began to kick and cuff him most unmercifully,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">287</a></span>
loading him with reproaches, until he was
forced to pause for want of breath; and then the
unhappy object of all this wrath was told that he
deserved to be thrown from the window of the
seventh story, for having deprived, by his carelessness,
an old chum and comrade of his day’s holiday,
by taking his new <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">soutane</i> in the dark, and
leaving his old rusty one in its place; and, worse
than all, depriving him of the means of diverting
his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ennui</i>, by robbing him of his money, three
bran new crowns which he had put aside for this
very occasion, and which he would find in the left-hand
pocket!</p>

<p>“The miracle was then explained! The poor
abbé, crest-fallen and discomfited, slunk away,
forced to confess the truth, and his utter inability
to make good the sum at that moment. The good-natured
M. de Sèze was, however, so diverted at
the adventure, that he thought himself amply revenged
for the annoyance he had suffered, by the
mortification which poor ‘Providence’ had to endure
and the disappointment he expressed at finding
that, after all, he had not been made the object
of a <em>miracle</em>.</p>

<p>“‘It is most extraordinary,’ said the prince, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">288</a></span>
had been telling me this anecdote of M. D——,
one day after he had just left us, ‘that this adventure
did not in any degree lessen his confidence in
the interposition of Providence in his affairs, notwithstanding
all the mockery and derision of which
he had been made the object after this misadventure.
On the contrary, he gave himself up with
the greatest confidence to the decrees of that Providence
which had never deceived him, and which
certainly bore him through the most perilous and
troublous times without harm or molestation. He
never emigrated during the revolution; he remained
at his post; and, whether he was deemed
too insignificant for annoyance, or whether, in consequence
of the great love which was borne him by
his parishioners, it was thought prudent to overlook
the fact of his remaining in the country, I know
not; but it is certain that, without defiance, and
yet without servility, he remained, and was unharmed—perhaps
the only instance throughout
the whole of France.</p>

<p>“‘Another specimen of his trust in Providence
is worth recording, as it may give you an insight
into the state of feeling at the time, and of the enthusiasm
which existed, even in remote country<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">289</a></span>
districts, at the period of the breaking up of the
old system. After leaving the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Séminaire</i>, M. D——
was appointed to a small cure in the neighbourhood
of Rambouillet, which yielded him not more
than about twelve hundred francs per annum. You
may readily suppose that, with a knowledge of this
fact, I was much surprised to find, on paying him
a visit at his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Presbytère</i>, that throughout the whole
country round his name was mentioned with
prayers and blessings by the poor: not for his
attention to their ghostly comforts, not for his
guidance in spiritual matters; but for his munificent
charities, his assistance in all their pecuniary
difficulties, wherein he always came to their aid,
with even more readiness than the inhabitants of
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">château</i> themselves. Meanwhile, as far as his
own personal indulgences were concerned, the
poorest peasant in his parish lived more sumptuously
than he.</p>

<p>“‘I found him in a ruinous old parsonage-house,
with scarcely the smallest of the comforts of life;
and yet full of the most splendid dreams of all the
happiness he meant to confer by his administration
in the district to which he had been appointed
pastor. There was to be no more misery, no more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">290</a></span>
want—the golden age was to be revived—in short,
his visions were much of the same nature, only partaking
of more simplicity, as those of your idol,
Fourier. I could not help smiling, as we sat down
to our repast of two hard-boiled eggs, and water <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à
discrétion</i>, to hear him declare his resolution of
enabling his parishioners to have each one, according
to the vow of Henri Quatre, a fat fowl to
boil for his Sunday dinner.</p>

<p>“‘But, my good friend, how will you be enabled
to procure for them all these luxuries?’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, I have hit upon a plan,’ replied he, chuckling
with glee, ‘which is a much better financial
scheme, than any ever devised by either Calonne
or Necker. So simple too—to be understood by
the meanest capacity;’ as he spoke, he went to a
small cupboard in the wall, and drew from thence
a long string of old and dirty playing cards. ‘This
is my coin,’ exclaimed he, triumphantly, waving the
greasy mass before my eyes; ‘with these simple
pieces, which my poor pensioners deliver to the
various tradespeople, they can procure in the village,
food, fire, and clothing—with these old cards,
begged from my evening games of piquet with the
old Marquise de Beaugency, I can purchase for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">291</a></span>
them the comforts, without which they cannot
live.’</p>

<p>“‘But in the name of Heaven, who will pay the
providers?’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, I must trust to Providence for that!’</p>

<p>“‘I must confess that I left my worthy friend
with a mind full of uneasiness, notwithstanding his
trust—the more so, when I found, upon inquiry,
that he was deeply indebted in every direction for
the very provisions which he continued to distribute
with such lavish hand. But so great was the
respect his name inspired—so great the confidence
felt by his flock in his honour and integrity, that
no alarm was experienced respecting the payment,
it being imagined generally, that he was the agent
of some rich and charitable person, for the distribution
of these alms, and that they would be paid
as soon as he himself received the money. After
having given him for his poor what I could spare—a
mere drop in the ocean, when viewed with reference
to the heaviness of the debts which he had
incurred—I took my departure, full of anxiety respecting
the future consequences of this thoughtless
expenditure on the part of one, whose whole
stock of worldly goods would not have satisfied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">292</a></span>
the demands of even one of his numerous creditors.</p>

<p>“‘However, other more serious events coming,
meanwhile, to occupy my attention, I lost sight of
my old friend, or if ever I <em>did</em> think of him, it was
with a faint terror, lest, never having heard of him
since my visit to Rambouillet, he might have been
reported to the bishop of his diocese, and have incurred
imprisonment and disgrace for his imprudent
practices. The great encounter between the
people and their rulers had commenced, and all
France was summoned to assist at the first parley,
before hostilities began—the assembling of the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">états généraux</i> at Versailles.</p>

<p>“‘I arrived at Versailles the day before the
procession from the Palace to St. Louis, and was
walking arm and arm with Sièyes upon the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tapis
vert</i>, gazing with curiosity on the scene. The day
was heavenly, (it sometimes seems to me as though
we have no such weather now, as we had then,) the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tapis vert</i> was crowded—courtiers in their court
costume—officers in uniform—the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">haut clergé</i>
attired with the brilliant tokens of the rank each
held in the Church—were all gathered in groups,
either sauntering beneath the shade of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">charmille</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">293</a></span>
hedge, where the first tender buds of May were
just sufficient to screen the promenaders from the
rays of the spring-tide sun—or else seated on the
stone benches along the alleys, conversing with the
ladies, who, all adorned in the gayest colours, and
wearing the brightest smiles, seemed bent on rendering
the holiday as brilliant as it was possible
it could be.</p>

<p>“‘On the other side, (the truth <em>may</em> be told
now without mischief,) avoided by the rest, as
though they bore the seeds of pestilence within
them, the members of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tiers état</i> conversed in
busy, whispering knots; no merry laughter was
heard from <em>them</em>, no pleasant trifling or mirthful
jesting was seen lighting up <em>their</em> discourse. All
was dark and gloomy, care sat on every brow, and
that their converse was of weighty matters, was evident,
by the tone of mystery in which it was carried
on, and the sudden silence which took place among
them whenever any stray member of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">noblesse</i>
happened to pass by to join the glittering throng
on the other side. Their very costume contrasted
strongly with that of their contemptuous superiors;
they all wore, and contrary to anticipation, were
<em>proud</em> to wear the dress to which they had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">294</a></span>
condemned—the black hose and surtout, and short
black cloak, which, by the antique sumptuary law,
denoted the vile, base-born <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">roturier</i>.</p>

<p>“‘It was altogether a scene such as I shall never
forget while memory has power to act. I never
remember in my whole life to have been inspired
with so profound a sentiment of melancholy as at
that hour. I could scarcely refrain from shedding
tears, at perceiving, by what was already taking place,
what must of necessity come to pass before long.
As we drew near to the palace, the long windows
of the suite of apartments looking towards the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Pièce d’Apollon</i>, and then known as the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Appartements
du Dauphin</i>, were thrown open, and out
rushed, like a flight of butterflies, the whole bevy
of court beauties, all in high glee, in towering
spirits, elated at the prospect of the morrow’s pageant,
which they evidently looked upon but as a
show wherein they were to see much that would
amuse, and wherein they should be seen to the
very best advantage, as, fortunately, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Salle des
Menus</i> was lighted from <em>above</em>, which was so much
more favourable to the effect of rouge and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mouches</i>
than the broad, glaring, side light of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">grande
galerie</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">295</a></span>
I cannot tell you how the sound of that joyous
laughter grated on my ear, as it caused both Sièyes
and myself to pause while we watched those light
forms, as they playfully chased each other on the
terrace among the flowers. The queen was with
them there; and I think I see her now, as she stood
leaning for support against the pedestal of the statue
of Silenus, opposite to the marble staircase, so
greatly was she overcome by the fit of laughter into
which she had been thrown by some absurd mistake
on the part of the Countess de Provence, for
her ringing voice and childlike accent reached our
ears as we stood close below the balustrade, as she
exclaimed, pointing to her sister-in-law, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Cette
chère Sœur</i> will <em>never</em> learn to speak French!”
That radiant face and beaming eye could not at
such a moment be seen without exciting a feeling
of <em>pity</em>, and this I know was shared by Sièyes, for,
without uttering a word, he pressed my arm significantly,
and led me from the spot towards a group
of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tiers-état</i> who were standing at the entrance
of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bosquets</i>. As we drew near, I descried the
Abbé Maury, who was, as usual, declaiming with all
his might, although in a low tone, to an eager
crowd of listeners. Just as we came up, he concluded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">296</a></span>
some section of his discourse with this question,
‘Eh bien, Messieurs, if the noblesse treat us
so, what are we to do?’</p>

<p>“‘<em>Why, trust to Providence!</em>’ was the answer,
from one of those standing near. The voice made
me start, so little was I prepared to hear it in such
a place. I turned to the speaker—it was indeed
my own dear D——!</p>

<p>“‘Of course my inquiries and his replies followed
each other in rapid succession, and I was
almost led to believe that his philosophy was the
best that had ever been devised, when he informed
me that he had come to Versailles as representative
of the clergy, deputed by his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">commune</i>, the electors
being of course in this, as in every other case,
compelled to disburden him of his debts before he
could leave the canton. ‘It was quite unexpected,’
said the good man, ‘almost a miracle; for how
could I dream even a short month ago of deputies,
and notables, and gatherings at Versailles. You
see I was right in trusting to Heaven for relief.
However, it <em>did</em> astonish the worthy <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bourgeois</i> a
little, when they discovered how dearly they would
have to pay for their choice; and they might perhaps
have cancelled it had such a proceeding been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">297</a></span>
allowed. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mais, c’est égal!</i>—summer is coming on,
harvest time will soon draw near, and the poor of
my parish have, meanwhile, been clothed and fed!’</p>

<p>“‘It would perhaps be difficult to meet with a
more beautiful realization of the spirit of Scripture
than is to be found in this anecdote. He has met
with his reward, for “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mes pauvres</i>,” as he always
called his little flock, protected him through the
dangers and persecutions which he subsequently
had to undergo; and, at the Restoration, he was appointed
to the cure of St. Thomas, one of the best
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bénéfices</i> of Paris, which he still holds, and where,
until these very few years, when, from old age, he
has become incapacitated for preaching, he was
wont to deliver many and many a pithy sermon
upon the wonderful “bounty of Providence.”’</p>

<p>“There is scarcely a visitor at the Hotel Talleyrand,”
resumed C., “who does not, as in the case
of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">curé</i> of St. Thomas, elicit some quaint history,
some <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">piquant</i> anecdote of days gone by, on
the part of the prince. His memory is so wonderful,
that he can scarcely relate the simplest trait of
his own life without being led into many other
stories illustrative of the times in which the incidents
happened, and to which he knows better than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">298</a></span>
any living being how to give a charm, an interest,
which will sometimes render the smallest circumstance
of value, and which is a gift so highly esteemed
by our nation, that <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">l’art de raconter</i> has ever
been placed far above any other accomplishment
in the qualifications requisite to form an agreeable
member of society. You will in general find the
prince <em>indulgent</em> when relating anecdotes even of
persons from whom it may be a well-known fact
that he has differed all his life. I have often heard
him say that ‘experience teaches us indulgence,’
and that ‘the wisest man is he who doubts his own
judgment with regard to the motives which actuate
his fellow-men.’ I have sometimes heard him entertain
his intimate circle, during a long evening,
with a vast number of amusing traits and anecdotes
relating to his ‘fellow-labourers in the vineyard,’
without once having recourse to scandal or ridicule;
which I consider the very perfection of the
story-teller’s science. The only person with whose
name he likes, even now, sometimes, to disport himself
in his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">moments de malice</i> is Madame Necker,
whom he never could tolerate, and with whom, even
in her most palmy days, he scrupled not to declare
himself openly at war. He really <em>felt</em> with regard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">299</a></span>
to her what he so happily expressed, ‘She has
every virtue and but one fault, and that is, she is
insupportable!’ The good lady never forgave his
comparing her to a ‘frigate riding at anchor, and
receiving a salute from a friendly power,’ when she
stood upon her own hearth-rug at the Hôtel Necker,
upon the occasion of her weekly receptions; her
ample proportions obscuring the light of the fire,
as, with pinched-up features and prudish smile, she
listened to the compliments of the Academicians,
whom she assembled but for this purpose. The
‘strait-laced Genevese,’ as he calls her, has furnished
him, I verily believe, with more witty <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bon
mots</i>, with more stinging epigrams, than even his
most bitter enemy.</p>

<p>“His feeling towards her daughter, Madame de
Staël, has much of the same nature. To this hour,
his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">amour propre</i> is wounded by the obligation he
owes her for having obtained, through her credit
with Barras, his recall from exile, and thus, in
reality, laid the foundation of his fortune. This
unwillingness to own a debt may savour somewhat
of ingratitude; but the prince will be excused when
it is remembered that Madame de Staël possessed,
in common with all persons of a nervous, irritable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">300</a></span>
temperament, an excess of that susceptibility which
phrenologists have denominated ‘approbativeness,’
which made her over-value her success, and never
cease bringing it to the memory of the person
obliged. This, to a proud, sarcastic temper like
that of the prince, must have been peculiarly
annoying, the more so as Napoleon, with the gross,
soldier-like want of tact which he would sometimes
display, loved to remind him both of the immensity
of the service, and by whom it had been rendered,
and then would laugh coarsely to see him
wince under the reproach, which all his wonted
philosophy did not enable him to bear with calmness.</p>

<p>“He had never the same high opinion of Madame
de Staël which the world professed. He thought her
style pedantic and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">guindé</i>, and would complain,
when any of her compositions were read to him, of
their total want of nature and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coloris</i>. I have often
heard him say, that those who read the writings
might fairly boast of knowing the writer, for that
nothing could more resemble Madame de Staël
herself than the false, exaggerated sentiments and
superficial erudition of her compositions. I have
seldom seen him enjoy more keenly a story than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">301</a></span>
the one he will sometimes tell of an adventure
which befel Madame de Staël at a party where he
himself was present. I think it was at a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">fête
champêtre</i> given by Madame Helvetius at her
pretty little château at Auteuil. The garden was
full of all the talent of Europe and America combined,
for it was just at the height of the American
mania, and the fête, indeed, was given to the great
champion of liberty, the regenerator of his race—<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">l’homme
de la nature</i>—the immortal Franklin. I
could tell you, by the bye, some curious circumstances
connected with the great patriot, which
you, as an Englishman, would be glad to hear, and
which I am sure the prince would be equally glad
to communicate, for he has but small esteem for
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">faux bonhomme</i>, as he called him.</p>

<p>“Madame Helvetius was one of the most charming
women that the world ever produced. The
style and type of such beings seem lost ever since
the revolution. Without being strictly handsome,
she always succeeded, without effort, in obtaining
more admiration than the professed beauties who
might be in the same company with her. There
was a charm, a grace in every action, in every
word she uttered, which has never been surpassed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">302</a></span>
Although she herself possessed no literary talent,
there was not a celebrity in Europe who was not
proud of her notice; and her assemblies in Paris,
and her fêtes at Auteuil are not forgotten to this
day. Upon the occasion to which I refer, Madame
de Staël was making her <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">début</i> in the Parisian literary
world, and calculating upon even more success
than she obtained, although, had she been a person
of moderate pretensions, she would have been more
than satisfied. She had just arrived in Paris; she
herself and all those connected with her, had been
bright particular stars in the somewhat dim and
cloudy horizon of Geneva.</p>

<p>“On her first appearance at the réunion,
Madame Helvetius had, of course, with well-bred
courtesy, paid her most particular attention, but
having other guests to welcome, had left her after
a while, to superintend the distribution of the
amusements about the grounds. Once or twice she
had passed Madame de Staël sitting gloomily on
the bench where she had left her, and at last sent
M. de Talleyrand to keep her company; but M. de
Talleyrand had tact enough to know that, being
himself no literary lion, he was no company for
Madame de Staël, and so immediately went in
quest of society more congenial to her taste. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">303</a></span>
soon returned, in company with the Abbé Monti,
whose poems were at that time the rage all over
Europe, and whose coming put the fair authoress
into the best of humours. M. de Talleyrand
sate down on the bench beside them, in silence,
feeling himself quite extinguished by so much
talent, and remained a passive listener, anxious
for improvement. The conversation was overwhelming
with erudition, and then the compliments
were poured forth like rain from an
April sky,—the Abbé ‘had never reckoned upon so
great an honour as that of meeting the first writer
of the age;’ madame ‘little dreamed when she
arose that morning, that the day would be marked
by so auspicious an event as the meeting with the
Abbé.’</p>

<p>“‘I have devoured every word that has escaped
from Sappho’s pen,’ said the abbé.</p>

<p>“‘I cannot sleep until I read the charming odes
from the Italian “Tyrtæus,”’ said the lady.</p>

<p>“‘Have you seen my last endeavour?’ said the
abbé.</p>

<p>“‘Alas! not yet,’ sighed the lady, ‘although report
speaks of it more highly than of any which
have preceded it.’</p>

<p>“‘I have it here!’ exclaimed the abbé, eagerly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">304</a></span>
drawing a small volume from his pocket. ‘Allow
me to present it to you, madame; a poor homage,
indeed, to so much genius, but it may prove interesting
to one who has had so much success in
heroic poetry.’</p>

<p>“‘Thanks, thanks,’ cried Madame de Staël,
seizing the little volume with every demonstration
of overpowering gratitude. ‘This is indeed a
treasure, and will be prized by me far beyond gold
or jewels.’</p>

<p>“She turned over the leaves slowly, while the
delighted abbé watched her with a charming self-complacency—then
suddenly dropping it into her
lap, she exclaimed, turning on the abbé a languid
glance, ‘You were talking of heroic poetry, dear
abbé; have you seen my last attempt—a dramatic
scene, “l’Exilé”—a slight and poor imitation of
some of your own?’</p>

<p>“‘I have not been so blessed as to obtain a
copy,’ replied the abbé.</p>

<p>“‘How fortunate that I should have one in my
reticule!’ said madame, hurriedly seizing the
strings of the bag suspended from her arm, and
drawing forth a thin volume in boards. The abbé
bent low over it as she presented it, and kissing it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">305</a></span>
with reverence, placed it by his side, and the conversation—that
is to say, the complimenting—was
continued with redoubled vigour.</p>

<p>“M. de Talleyrand then departed, and did not
return till the company broke up, when he found
that they had both left the bench whereon they
had been seated so long together, leaving, however,
the ‘precious treasures,’ which they had received
from each other with so much gratitude,
behind them! M. de Talleyrand seized upon
them with inexpressible delight, thinking that they
would furnish matter for innocent <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">persiflage</i>, when
the loss came to be remembered by either party.
But the thing was complete—<em>they were never
sought and never asked for</em>, and he has them now
in his library, and loves to show them as he tells
the story of their coming into his possession.</p>

<p>“It is in this manner,” said C., as he pulled
out his watch, surprised at the lateness of the hour,
“that M. de Talleyrand will sometimes entertain
us with familiar histories of many whom the world
has set upon pedestals of its own erecting, and
from which he is fain to bring them down, although
without scorn or malice, in order that we may see
them more closely and know them better. You<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">306</a></span>
will now understand the reason why it must be so
difficult to write a good ‘Life of Prince Talleyrand;’
there would be so little of himself, compared
to what must be told of other people—the work
would be so full of digressions, that it would become
as bulky as a cyclopædia. Besides, a single
person could not do the whole. It would require
writers of different talent, of different character, of
different nations—I was almost going to say of
different ages—to do justice to the varied scenes
wherein he himself displayed such variety of
talents.”</p>

<p>“Then why do you not, my dear friend, seize
upon the branch which you have at your own disposal,
and give the world the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vie Anecdotique</i> of
the prince?” said I. “Supposing you were to
begin and try your skill by relating to me by way
of practice before you publish?”</p>

<p>“Well, well, the idea is not a bad one,” said
C., laughing heartily; “it is certainly not the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">matériel</i> that would be wanting, and when we have
time and solitude it may amuse us both. <em>One</em>
talent at least is secure, for you are undoubtedly a
capital listener.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII" class="vspace">CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE COUNTESS DE LA MOTTE, OF NECKLACE NOTORIETY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It will easily be believed that I did not lose
sight of the promise which my friend had made
with so much <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bonhomie</i>, and the very first time I
found myself alone with him, I did not forget to
claim it. The opportunity occurred soon after the
conversation I have just recorded. We were pacing
together the long picture-gallery of the château;
the rain was beating in torrents against the Gothic
casements, and all hopes of going abroad had been
abandoned. The prince had not left his chamber
that morning. He was busily engaged, and had
announced his intention of remaining <em>invisible</em>
until dinner. He was occupied “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à faire son
Courier</i>,” as he called it, upon which occasion I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">308</a></span>
have known him sign and send off an entire bag
full of letters, not one of which was despatched
without having first been carefully perused and
corrected by himself. The facility and precision
with which he could always find the exact word
which was needed, and which his secretaries would,
perhaps, have been seeking for some time in vain,
was matter of the greatest admiration to all who
witnessed it; but he could neither write nor dictate
with ease; the most trifling <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">petit billet</i> which,
when completed, appeared the very model of graceful
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">laiser-aller</i> and badinage, often gave him as
much trouble to indite as one of his most complicated
despatches.</p>

<p>This, I think, may be attributable to the neglect
of his early education. Subsequent study and
careful reading may impart taste and erudition, but
can rarely give facility. C. told me that he has
known the prince remain for more than a week
upon the composition of a letter of condolence or
congratulation, if it chanced to be addressed to a
brother wit, or one of whose criticism he might
happen to stand in awe. In these cases, he would
cause his secretary to write two or three letters, in
different styles, upon the subject he had at heart,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">309</a></span>
and would then compile from the number, one in
his own writing, with his own piquant additions
and improvements, which was soon bandied from
hand to hand, and quoted in every <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i> as a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chef-d’œuvre</i>
of wit and epigram. Those who were in
the secret would smile at the unbounded praise
bestowed by the journals upon the composition of
his despatches (some of which are really masterpieces),
and the wording of his protocols; for they
well knew that they would scarcely have attracted
a single moment’s notice had the truth been
known.</p>

<p>“Does he give much time to the writing of his
memoirs?” asked I of C., as he was pacing thoughtfully
the polished oaken boards of the gallery, in
which the double line of pictures, which garnish
the walls on either side, is reflected as in a mirror,
so that at each step we seemed to tread upon the
semblance of some great king or warrior; for, with
a tacit self-homage, the prince had furnished the
gallery with the portraits of the sovereigns and
great men of all countries, with whom he had come
in contact.</p>

<p>“I think his memoirs were concluded some years
ago,” replied C., in answer to my question, “and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">310</a></span>
that they have been deposited in safety, out of the
pale of his own country, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">comme de raison</i>, where
they will remain until the time fixed by himself for
their publication shall have expired. Many competent
judges are of opinion that, even at that distant
period, the interest of their promulgation to
the world will be but little diminished. There is
yet so much mystery, so much which has been
withheld from public scrutiny, in all the great
political changes which have taken place, that
there will be as much novelty in the plain, straight-forward
narrative of the causes which led to their
occurrence, as though they were events of yesterday.
From the very first years of the reign of
Louis Seize, when the tone and manners of society
yet smacked of the wild and dissolute freedom of
the Regency, to the restraint and affectation of the
Restoration, has M. de Talleyrand always borne a
part in public affairs. Always floating on the tide
of circumstance, he has kept himself in full view
of the wondering crowd of beholders, while many
of those who had set forth with better chances of
success, by opposing the current, have been overwhelmed
by its resistless rush.</p>

<p>“There cannot exist a greater proof of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">311</a></span>
cleverness and good taste, than his steady avoidance
of anything like public condemnation. He
has been <em>accused</em> of every crime of which humanity
can be guilty, according to the caprice or fury of
his enemies, but not even a misdemeanour has
ever been <em>proved</em> against him. Even so long ago
as when he was as yet, according to his own expression,
‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">un assez mince particulier</i>,’ long before
the revolution, he had tact and sense enough to steer
clear of intrigue, and to avoid the society of those
who were suspected of dabbling in obscure political
manœuvre. Indeed, had he not been wise beyond
his years, he could not have escaped intimacy with
the Prince-Cardinal, Louis de Rohan, he who has
become famous in history for his credulity in the
affair of the diamond necklace, and who, fool as he
was, has yet been by many historians quoted as
the origin, the first great cause, of the Revolution.
This prelate, who at the time when M. de Talleyrand
was a simple abbé, waiting for preferment,
was already at the very acmé of dignity and power,
spared no pains to conciliate the young ecclesiastic.
But the Abbé de Perigord was already possessed
of too much discernment not to be fully aware that
these advances were less owing to any merit of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">312</a></span>
own, than to the circumstance of his mother being
at the time <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Dame du Palais</i> to Marie Antoinette,
whose good graces it had become a kind of monomania
with the unfortunate cardinal to gain. The
prince, to this very day, however, blesses the good
fortune which sent him from Paris upon business
connected with his office as <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Agent du Clergé</i>, just
at the very moment when the poor befooled cardinal,
and his wily accomplice, were in the very
thickest of their plot; so that his name was never
mentioned throughout the whole course of the proceedings,
neither as frequenter of the cardinal’s
hôtel, nor even as an acquaintance of his.”</p>

<p>“Did he ever chance to meet with Madame de
la Motte?”</p>

<p>“But once, and that was on the very occasion
of his going to take leave of the cardinal, before
he left Paris. He had been invited to sup with
his Eminence, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en petit comité</i>, and had come, prepared
to undergo long and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ennuyeux</i> discourses
upon the various duties of his new office—the
necessity of vigilance in detecting fraud—of conciliation
to prevent discord; in short, he almost
dreaded the interview, fully anticipating the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mauvais
quart d’heure</i> which is usually spent by a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">313</a></span>
young, inexperienced priest, when delivered up defenceless
to the torrent of recommendations and
warning, of advice and moral instances, which invariably
fall to his share when alone with his
superior. Great, therefore, was the astonishment
of the Abbé de Perigord, when, in spite of the
terms in which the invitation had been couched in
the cardinal’s own hand-writing—‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Venez souper
tête-à-tête avec moi</i>’—to find the apartment into
which he was ushered blazing with light, and signs
of ceremony and festivity evident in all the arrangements
which had been made for his reception.</p>

<p>“‘I found,’ said the prince, in whose words I will
tell you the history of this adventure, ‘on entering
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">petit salon</i>, which was already lighted with perfumed
tapers, and redolent of the fragrant essences
which the cardinal loved so much, seated by the
blazing fire, which was, according to the custom of
the Hôtel Cardinal, composed of scented woods, a
lady, whom I instantly recognised as the Princesse de
Guéménée, ex-governess to the royal children, but
who had some time before been compelled to resign
office, in consequence of the disgraceful bankruptcy
of her husband, which had not a little contributed
to lower the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">noblesse</i> in the eyes of the people, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">314</a></span>
formed one of the most astounding events by which
that turbulent era was marked. The princess was
alone; which circumstance rather astonished me,
for I had come prepared with an apology for being
late, and I wondered at the absence of the cardinal,
as it was already considerably past the time at
which he had requested me to be present. The
princess herself seemed annoyed as I entered. She
had evidently been waiting for some time, for she
was in no very pleasant humour, and scarcely
deigned to return a civil acknowledgment to my
humble salutations and inquiries. However, I was
easily consoled for any mortification I might have
experienced at this apparent indifference, for the
poor princess had but few ideas to dispense, and I
therefore considered that it might be as a matter of
prudence that she hesitated about wasting them on
so humble an individual as myself.</p>

<p>“‘Upon this occasion, I was contented with
warming my hands at the scented blaze, and gazing
on the portly form of the princess, reclining in
ample majesty on the green satin fauteuil before
me. Perhaps there never existed a type of ridicule
and exaggeration more strongly defined than the
Princesse de Guéménée, particularly at this period<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">315</a></span>
of her life, when, having lost, by extravagance and
folly, the position to which she was entitled by birth
and fortune, she appeared as though seeking to
gain distinction in another way, by exaggerating the
follies of the times, and affording in her person a
complete epitome of all the extravagance and bad
taste for which the court had become, even then,
proverbial. At the very hour of which I am speaking,
even when under the ban of dismissal from the
court, of reproval from the sovereign, and of the
condemnation of all persons of credit and character
throughout the kingdom—when it was a notorious
fact that her husband and herself were paying
loans upon the estates which yet remained to
them at the rate of fifty and seventy per cent.—was
she attired in all the absurd and costly frippery
which a depraved fashion might have excused
some years before, when she was yet in possession
of the stupendous fortune which so long had caused
the Rohans to rival in splendour the sovereign
himself, but which would only excite pity and disgust
in the minds of those aware of the desperate
state of her affairs.</p>

<p>“‘She was attired in a robe of I know not what
kind of rich stuff, which stood on end, and completely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">316</a></span>
filled the immense arm-chair in which she
was seated. This again was entirely covered with
the richest lace, which, looped with ornaments in
brilliants, representing <em>scorpions</em>, fell over either
elbow of the chair, completely disguising its form,
thus leaving the princess to represent to the beholder
the richly-decorated joss of some Chinese
temple, that scorns, in virtue of its divinity, the
support which mortals need when seated. Altogether
I scarcely ever remember to have seen a
more ridiculous figure than that of the Princesse de
Guéménée as she sat thus before me, the light of
the fire dancing upon the diamonds with which she
was covered from head to foot, now resting upon
the thick rouge upon her cheeks, then flying off to
some absurd and comical ornament with which she
had thought fit to load the towering fabric of her
powdered hair, and making her countenance take
all kinds of fantastic expressions, as though she
had been the sport of some merry demon.</p>

<p>“‘I endeavoured, as in duty bound, to divert
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ennui</i> under which the princess was labouring,
by trying to recount some of the latest
news of the court. I had just returned from
Versailles, where I had spent the day bidding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">317</a></span>
adieu to my friends, and thought that it might be
agreeable to her to hear the newest gossip. But I
could gain no attention. She suffered me to talk
on until I was weary, and I could see that she was
not paying the slightest heed to my endeavours to
amuse her. Suddenly, and in the midst of one of
my most diverting anecdotes, she roused herself by
a strong effort from the fit of abstraction into which
she had been plunged, and turned sharply round
towards me.</p>

<p>“‘You say you have just returned from Versailles?’</p>

<p>“‘As I have had the honour to tell you,
princess.’</p>

<p>“‘Did you hear of my nephew being at court,
to-day?’</p>

<p>“‘Indeed I did not hear the cardinal’s name
pronounced during the whole day, although I did
not leave until the latest hour of admission.’</p>

<p>“‘<em xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mon Dieu!</em>’ exclaimed the princess, in a tone
of the deepest emotion, ‘then he has gone thither
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en secret avec cette intrigante</i>!”</p>

<p>“‘These were her very words, and, just as she
had pronounced them, the rattle of carriage-wheels
was heard in the court-yard of the Hôtel Cardinal,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">318</a></span>
and presently a great noise and bustle were heard
upon the staircase, with loud laughter in a female
voice, which seemed to give a sort of nervous
spasm to the poor Princesse de Guéménée, for she
opened and shut the huge fan which she carried,
with a loud, impatient jerk, each time that the
echo of that excited laughter reached the little
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i> where we were seated. At length, the door
opened, and the cardinal entered, leading by the
hand, or rather, as was the fashion of the time, by
the tips of the fingers, a lady whom he introduced
to the princess as the Comtesse de Valois de la
Motte. The name excited my curiosity, for I had
heard her story but a short time before from the
lips of my mother, and had been much moved by
her misfortunes. I looked at the lady with the
greatest interest, and with a predetermination to
discover traces of her royal descent in her person
and demeanour. I was moreover wounded by the
coldness of the manner of the princess towards
her. I thought her conduct uncivil and inhospitable
in the extreme. She never rose from her
chair on the introduction taking place, but had
preserved the same idol-like rigidity of posture,
neither did she even condescend to return a smile<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">319</a></span>
in acknowledgment of all the sweet things with
which the Comtesse de la Motte ceased not to
overwhelm her from the first moment of her entrance—assuring
her that she had been longing for
this meeting for some time past—that there was no
one in the world whose acquaintance she had so much
desired to make as that of the Princesse de Guéménée—in
short, all the common-place flatteries
with which little people are in the habit of soothing
and allaying the adverse tempers of the great.</p>

<p>“‘It is a singular fact (and I do assure you the
notion has not been forced upon my imagination by
subsequent events), but I was struck with the extreme
vulgarity of the tone of her address to the princess,
even in the few moments which preceded our summons
to the supper-table; and I had already a
certain misgiving about the character of the lady
from this circumstance alone. But I reserved my
definitive judgment of her until we were ushered
into the supper-room, for the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">petit salon</i> was lighted
with lamps of alabaster, and the light, thus beautifully
softened to the eye, was rendered too dim
to enable one to distinguish the play of the features,
the changes of expression, all the little tokens
of character which are exhibited in the countenance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">320</a></span>
when under the influence of any one predominant
passion. I waited then, with patience, until we
were comfortably seated at supper. By good fortune,
my place was opposite to the comtesse, and I
was thus enabled to contemplate her to my heart’s
content. It was fortunate, too, that she scarcely
deigned to notice my presence, so absorbed was
she in her endeavours to win a smile from the
princess. I was thus rendered a mere spectator of
a scene, which time and the subsequent events that
took place have rendered worthy of being registered
among my own most interesting <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">souvenirs</i>.</p>

<p>“‘As to the cardinal, when once he had apologized
to me for his late return to the hôtel,
and excused himself upon the plea of having
been detained at Versailles upon business connected
with the affairs of Madame la Comtesse,
he scarcely seemed to remember that I was in
existence, so entirely engrossed was he with the
efforts he was compelled to make, in order to
excite the princess to conversation on the one
hand, and to restrain the volubility of the Comtesse
de la Motte on the other. The contrast
between the two female guests of the cardinal was,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">321</a></span>
indeed, striking, and one was led to wonder at
seeing them together at the same table.</p>

<p>“‘You have already heard the description of
Madame de Guéménée: now, Madame de la Motte
was, in all points of outward appearance and manner,
exactly the reverse of that mighty dame. She
was a small, lively person, full of fire, and talking
with a strong accent and active gesticulation. She
was, without doubt, what, in the world, is called a
pretty woman, for she had a fine complexion, with
sparkling black eyes, and a superb range of ivory
teeth, which she took every pains to display, by an
incessant twist of her lips, which I remember to
this day, as having produced the most unpleasant
effect possible upon my nerves. She had a remarkable
profusion of really fine chestnut hair,
which was but half-powdered, and clustered in most
bewitching ringlets round her face. Her age might
have been about seven or eight-and-twenty—the
very age most to be dreaded in woman; the mind,
possessing all the experience of maturity—the person
yet retaining all the bloom and charm of youth.
Her attire was well chosen to set off her complexion,
but it shocked my taste to witness the
profusion of ornament and jewels with which she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">322</a></span>
was adorned, even while speaking of herself as a
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pauvre solliciteuse</i>, to whom a miserly government
would only accord a beggarly pension of eight hundred
livres. Her diamonds, indeed, rivalled both
in beauty and profusion those of the Princesse de
Guéménée herself, and her dress consisted of a robe
of orange-coloured <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">brocatelle</i>, shot with black, and
flowered with gold. Her hands and arms were
hidden by long gloves of Spanish kid, and I could
readily imagine that there was coquetry in this
precaution, as the hardships in which her early
years had been spent, must, of necessity, have left
their traces <em>there</em>.</p>

<p>“‘I remember being struck with the reflection
which forced itself upon me at the time, and being
lost in admiration as I gazed upon the Comtesse
de la Motte, at the extreme ease and facility with
which she had acquired the jargon and petty graces
of high society. Her manners certainly gave the
lie direct to the old prejudice, that it requires many
years of apprenticeship to become an adept in the
fashionable art. Neither did she betray at first, by
any one triviality or vulgarity of expression or pronunciation,
that she had not all her life been accustomed
to the society in which she then found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">323</a></span>
herself. The only peculiarity which might have
excited suspicion in <em>very</em> particular persons, was
the hurry and agitation in which she seemed to
exist—a perpetual restlessness—an over-desire to
excite interest and to produce effect. Mind you,
I am speaking of the first hour or so, while yet she
was uncertain as to the opinion which the princess
might have formed of her. But after this restraint
had a little worn off, and she had grown a little less
guarded in her conversation, I began to perceive
many incongruities in her behaviour. The effect
was most extraordinary—she appeared, at one and
the same moment, two distinct characters; her very
voice altered, sometimes before she had concluded
her sentence.</p>

<p>“‘I must do the Princesse de Guéménée the justice
to declare that, throughout the whole evening, her
conduct was perfect. She listened in silence, but
without any evidence of ill-humour or contempt,
to all the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">agaceries</i> and lively sallies with which
the comtesse sought so earnestly to divert her.
She even condescended, now and then, to applaud,
but without favour, and from a distance, as she
would have done from her box at the Opera to the
successful efforts of the actress whose talent might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">324</a></span>
for a moment have succeeded in charming her
into this demonstration of approval. But it was
when, at the solicitation of the cardinal, excited
with the wine, of which she had partaken unsparingly,
and elevated by the hope of winning
the good graces of the company, Madame de la
Motte launched forth into the eternal history of her
“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">infortunes</i>,” which had been her great <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">moyen de
succès</i> with the numberless dupes she had made,
that to me all delusion ceased at once. The imposture
was easy to discover beneath the envelope
of affected high breeding with which she had at
first concealed her determination of charming the
princess, and the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">aventurière</i> stood revealed without
disguise.</p>

<p>“‘I know that you will suspect my judgment of
being influenced by the conclusion of her story;
but I do assure you that even then I could not
help wondering that his Eminence should have
admitted to his intimacy a person like Madame de
la Motte. It has since become matter of surprise
to all the world, that the cardinal, credulous and
simple as it had pleased Heaven to make him,
could ever have been so beguiled as to give the
slightest degree of credit to her representations;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">325</a></span>
but as for me, after having passed that single evening
in her company, I almost feel inclined to
believe in witchcraft. There <em>must</em> have been some
evil power at work, when the Cardinal de Rohan
was delivered up to the possession (no other word
can express this infatuation) of the Comtesse de
Valois de la Motte!’</p>

<p>“‘How I should have liked to be present!’ said
I, ‘and to hear from her own lips the recital of her
adventures!’</p>

<p>“‘Bah!’ said the prince, laughing, ‘I can tell
you the tale, and if it prove as interesting to you
as it did to me, you will not forget it more than I
have done. I believe it to be strictly true in all
its main points. It is a singular story, and but
little known. She told it well, too, and I leave you
to judge of the effect which it must have produced
at the time.</p>

<p>“‘She said that her father, who, there can be
no doubt was, in reality, the Count de Saint Remy
de Valois, descended from Henry II., had sold the
whole of his estates to a rich <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fermier-général</i>, in
order to satisfy the debts incurred by the inordinate
love of splendour and expense in which his
wife had indulged since their marriage. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">326</a></span>
family was, in consequence, reduced to the very
lowest ebb of destitution and poverty. The mother,
who was the daughter of one of the Count de Saint
Remy’s vassals, had not strength of mind to bear
the poverty which her own extravagance had
brought upon her family, and fled, leaving her
husband and three children to endure the privations
which she was so ill-disposed to share. There
was an old Gothic ruin in the park, belonging
to what had once been the château of the Counts
de Saint Remy, and this the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fermier-général</i> consented
to give up to the count and his young
family. Hither, then, did the hapless little band
retire, with no hope but in Heaven. The count
became a confirmed misanthrope, and never stirred
from the old ruin from the moment that he had
fixed his abode within it. He suffered his hair and
beard to grow, and refused to hold communication
with any living being, save with his young children.
But he took little heed of their welfare, notwithstanding
his affection for them, nor seemed to care
whether they were provided with bread or left to
starve; and, had it not been for the kindness of the
peasants of the neighbourhood, who, with native
delicacy and good feeling, fearing to wound his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">327</a></span>
pride, would come in secret and at night to deposit
provisions upon the threshold of the mouldering
edifice wherein they had taken refuge, the whole
family would sometimes have been for days together
without a morsel of food.</p>

<p>“‘This, however, was far from being sufficient
to satisfy their wants, and the care of providing
food devolved, of course, upon the eldest child
Jeanne (Madame de la Motte herself). She
would wander along the public road from sunrise
to sunset, holding her little brother by the hand,
and carrying her sister, yet a helpless infant, on
her back, and thus the little trio, faint and weary,
and covered with sordid rags, would run by the
side of every carriage that passed on the highway,
calling out in a piteous tone, “Charity, charity, for
the love of God! A morsel of bread for three
poor starving orphans, descended from the royal
blood of the Valois!” This appeal failed not, of
course, to attract notice.</p>

<p>“‘I was fair, and pretty,’ said the comtesse, as
she told the tale, ‘and sometimes returned laden
with silver, which I hastened to convert into necessaries
for our use, and comforts for my father, ere
I sought my home at night. This state of things<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">328</a></span>
lasted fur more than two years. The old ruin had
fallen into greater decay; the count had fallen into
a state of greater gloom and apathy, scarcely ever
uttering a syllable to the children, nor seeming to
take the least notice of their departure or return,
nor of their efforts to procure for themselves and
him the nourishment which was needful to sustain
existence.</p>

<p>“‘One evening, poor Jeanne returned with her
little companions, weary and footsore, to the old
tower. They had been out a longer time than
usual, the day had been wild and stormy, and but
few travellers had passed the road, so that but small
profit had been made, and there was a prospect of
a supper even more scanty than usual. On entering
the tower, they were struck by the unwonted
silence and darkness of the place, for the count
generally took upon himself the charge of feeding
the fire, and at nightfall lighted a torch to read
over and over again, for the millionth time, the
genealogy of his family, and the title-deeds proving
his descent from the Valois, the only occupation
in which he now seemed to find amusement or consolation.</p>

<p>“‘Upon this occasion, however, all was dark<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329">329</a></span>
and silent as the grave, and Jeanne, after having
called her father without receiving any answer,
drew near to the hearth, and blew up the few remaining
embers into a sickly blaze, which just
sufficed to light the interior of the tower. Her
father was seated, drooping and motionless, in his
customary seat in the chimney corner, leaning
against the wall, with his head bent low upon his
bosom, and his hand upon his heart.’</p>

<p>“‘He is asleep,’ said Jeanne, to the little ones;
‘let us make no noise, but hurry to bed as quickly
as possible, that he may not be disturbed.’</p>

<p>“‘So she gave each of the children a morsel of
bread and a piece of the curd-cheese eaten by the
poor peasants in that part of the country, and they
all three sought in haste and silence the bundle of
straw allotted to their use. Here they slept soundly
until the dawn. Jeanne was the first to wake, and,
on perceiving the sunbeams struggling through the
loop-hole in the wall, rose with the hope of having
better luck than on the preceding day, and
hurriedly gathered on her rags, determined to set
forth at once upon her daily errand. She was just
preparing to rouse her little brother, when she was
struck with terror, on turning to bid adieu to her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330">330</a></span>
father, to perceive that he was still seated in the
chimney-nook, in the same attitude in which she
had found him on returning to the tower on the
evening before. He had passed the whole night
seated thus without moving; his head still drooping
on his bosom—his hand still pressed upon his
heart! There was something so unnatural in this
immobility, that the child, young as she was, felt
overcome with dread. She approached the count
and listened, but she heard not his breathing, nothing
but the beating of her own heart. She laid
her hand upon his shoulder, and pushed him
gently.</p>

<p>“‘Father, it is time to rise!’ said she, in a low
voice, and then the loud shriek, which burst from
her lips, echoed through the tower, and roused from
their slumber the two babes, who ran crying towards
her.</p>

<p>“‘The body of her father had yielded to her
touch, and had sunk forward into the fire-place,
where it lay upon the hearth, among the cold ashes.
It was evident that he had been dead for many
hours, and, in her fright, poor Jeanne, scarcely
knowing what to do, seized the little Marguerite in
her arms, and ran screaming from the tower, nor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331">331</a></span>
paused until she reached the town, where instantly,
with a prudence and foresight beyond her years,
she went to seek the curé. Great was the excitement
among the peasantry on the estate when they
heard of the death of the Count de St. Remy, and
they assembled in great numbers around the old
tower, and bore away the body to the chapel of the
château. But the hard-hearted <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fermier-général</i>,
well aware that his possession of the estate was
illegal—for the count had not the power to dispose
of the land, which belonged of right to his children
after him—refused to receive the corpse, and it
remained for two whole days outside the chapel-door,
whence it was carried to the burying-ground
of the village, where it was thrown without ceremony,
still covered with the rags in which he had
died, into the common fosse,—the curé having refused
the prayers of the church to one who had
died without its aid, consequently in a state of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">impénitence
finale</i>.</p>

<p>“‘After the death of her father, Jeanne, still,
as usual, accompanied by her little brother, and
carrying her sister on her back, set off on foot for
Paris, with the papers which proved her descent
from Henry II., and which constituted her whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332">332</a></span>
worldly store, all soiled and ragged, sown up in her
tattered <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">casaquin</i>. In this plight did she traverse
the whole of France, a distance of nearly two hundred
leagues, with no support by the way, but from
the charity of travellers, until she arrived at the last
stage of her journey, within one league of the capital.
She declared that, on that memorable day, she
had walked more than twenty miles, with the determination
of arriving at Paris before nightfall; but
here, just at the very moment of seeing her hopes
realized, she sank exhausted by the roadside, unable
to move a step farther. Her feet were torn and
bleeding, and she was drenched to the skin; the
rain, which had fallen in torrents during the whole
afternoon, had rendered the roads so slippery, that
her fatigue had been doubled; added to which, she
had scarcely tasted food since morning, for she discovered
that, as she drew nearer to the capital,
travellers were possessed of sterner feelings; they
either turned a deaf ear to her petition, or else
laughed to scorn the terms in which it was couched.</p>

<p>“‘Night was coming on apace; it was impossible
to remain till morning on the wet and muddy bank.
Her heart was pierced by the wailings of her little
sister, and the cries of her brother for food and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">333</a></span>
warmth were most piteous. Once more did she
call her courage to her aid, and essayed to walk, but
she was too weak, and, staggering forward a few
paces, fell with her head against a door in the wall,
which ran along the footpath. The shock burst it
open, and discovered to the astonished gaze of the
poor famished children, a scene which appeared
to them like fairy-land—a garden filled with blooming
shrubs and flowers, and lighted by myriads of
coloured lamps. There was no one walking in the
garden—the ground was too wet for that—but a
few paces from the gate stood a Chinese pavilion,
raised by a flight of steps from the ground, all decorated
with party-coloured streamers, and blazing
with light, within which was gathered a crowd
of magnificently-attired ladies and cavaliers, and
whence issued sounds of mirth and laughter, and
strains of low soft music. It was like a dream of
heaven! Jeanne never could tell who among this
gay company was the first to perceive the three
little miserable wanderers as they stood shivering
at the gate, for she stood entranced, until she was
brought back to reality by a loud voice shouting a
coarse reprimand to a servant in rich livery, who
was standing at the door of the pavilion, for having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334">334</a></span>
left the garden-gate unlocked. Presently the servant
in rich livery came hurriedly down the steps,
and taking Jeanne by the arm, was proceeding to
turn her without ceremony into the road, when a
sudden instinct caused her to resist the attack, and
springing forward with a desperate effort, with outstretched
arms, she darted towards the pavilion, and
called out in a piteous voice, in which the two
younger children joined, as soon as ever they heard
the first note, so familiar was the cry—“Charity—charity,
for the love of Heaven! A morsel of bread
for three poor starving orphans, <em>descendants of the
royal house of Valois</em>!”</p>

<p>“‘In an instant the whole company rushed to
the balcony which surrounded the pavilion, attracted
by the piercing shriek of Jeanne and the
novelty of the appeal. She had sunk upon her
knees at the foot of the balustrade, awaiting in
silence the success of her bold attack. For a moment
it was doubtful, for the lacquey in rich livery
had again got fast hold of the child’s arm, and in
obedience to the same rough command which had
sentenced her to a dismissal before, was about to
push her again towards the gate, when suddenly a
lady, one of the most richly attired among the company,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335">335</a></span>
calling to him in an authoritative tone to
desist, and forcing her way through the crowd,
came down the steps to where poor Jeanne was
still kneeling, pale and trembling, with her little
brother clinging to her skirts, and the baby-sister
wailing piteously at her back. The garden where
this scene took place belonged to the magnificent
château of M. le Marquis de Boulainvilliers, at
Passy; the gentleman who had commanded the
lacquey to turn the children from the gate was
M. de Boulainvilliers himself, and consequently
the lady who had desired him do so at his peril,
could be no other than Madame la Marquise de
Boulainvilliers!</p>

<p>“‘The fates had been kind indeed, when they
led poor Jeanne into the friendly domain of the
marquise. I knew her well: she was, I believe, a
truly benevolent person, but had perverted her real,
honest, charitable disposition into a sickly sentimentality,
by her intercourse with the Neckers, and her
admiration of all the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fade</i> doctrines emanating from
the academic grove established at Coppet. She was,
moreover “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">folle de ce cher Jean Jacques, l’homme
de la Nature, et citoyen de Genève</i>,” and raved
about sentiment and presentiment, and the errors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336">336</a></span>
and vices of civilization, and the far more preferable
state of savage life, and “the feelings implanted in
our bosoms by the God of Nature,” &amp;c.; until she,
being rather a portly person, and always overlaced,
would sometimes turn suddenly black in the face,
and alarm her auditors by a desperate fit of coughing,
which she owed to her asthma, and which was
only quelled by the exertions of the two tall valets
who stood behind her chair; the one patted her most
vigorously on the back, while the other jerked cold
water in her face from a glass ewer, which always
stood ready at hand for the purpose. This is the
only remembrance <em>I</em> have preserved of Madame de
Boulainvilliers; but, slight as it is, it will be quite
sufficient to show you all the extent of the good
fortune which had befallen “the descendants of the
royal house of Valois.”</p>

<p>“‘The marquise took the poor child by the hand
and raised her from the ground, without any apparent
fear lest the contact of such dirty rags should
soil the coloured satin brocade in which she herself
was attired. She spoke to her kindly, and endeavoured
to soothe her agitation, and finally led the
whole party into the very midst of the assembly of
dainty ladies and mincing cavaliers, and made them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337">337</a></span>
repeat the extraordinary appeal which had attracted
her attention. Jeanne needed no pressing to induce
her to comply with her request, and the music
was hushed and the tittering of the company
silenced by the whining cry, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Charité! charité!</i>—a
morsel of bread for the starving orphans of the
royal house of Valois!”</p>

<p>“‘Curiosity was of course excited; the event
had given variety to the amusements of the evening.
Madame de Boulainvilliers questioned the
child, who told her history in a plain and artless
manner, and, when she had concluded, drew from
the lining of her <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">casaquin</i> the papers relating to
her birth, which Madame la Marquise read aloud
to the astonished assembly. There was a universal
movement in favour of the orphans; a most liberal
subscription was raised on the instant, everybody
present proposed assistance in some way or another
to get a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">placet</i> presented to the king, and so great
was the interest excited, that the worthy marquise
hurried them away to bed, fearing lest some one
else might rob her of her <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bonne œuvre</i>, by taking
charge of the children, concerning whom she had
already formed a multitude of projects in support
of her favourite theory. Here was a fine occasion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338">338</a></span>
for displaying the superiority of the philosophy of
Jean Jacques! What good fortune to have discovered
these children, fresh from the hands of
nature, uncorrupted by intercourse with the world,
and yet of noble, nay more, of royal blood! How
she would love to show to the incredulous and
scoffers at the new doctrines the wondrous effects
to be produced by the new system of education—the
candour, the innocence, the absence of all
artifice, which characterise the human heart when
untrammelled by the hypocritical conventions of
society! She really was alarmed lest any of her
friends should beg the children of her, and so
ordered them to be put to bed in the apartment
adjoining her own.</p>

<p>“‘Had they not better have a hot bath first?’
drily exclaimed the old Chevalier de Meylau.</p>

<p>“‘Fie, chevalier; there is no disgrace in their
neglected state. In all artificial communities like
ours, it is the seal affixed to poverty!’ exclaimed
the marquise, indignantly.</p>

<p>“‘Ay, or the <em>soil</em>,’ retorted the chevalier; but
fortunately the marquise did not hear him; she
had been seized with one of her most desperate
fits of coughing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339">339</a></span>
“‘Behold, meanwhile, the orphan mendicants,
whose resting-place the night before had been a
heap of filthy straw, beneath the manger of a cowshed,
reclining on a bed of down, beneath a velvet
canopy! But Jeanne declared to us that she did
not sleep a whit the sounder, so tormented was
she the whole of that night with the fear that
Madame de Boulainvilliers might keep and appropriate
to her own use the title-deeds which she
had imprudently suffered to pass from her hands,
and which she had been used to regard as the
means whereby she should one day be raised to a
level with royalty itself. So much for the candour
and innocence, and freedom from suspicion, upon
which poor Madame de Boulainvilliers had reckoned
so blindly!</p>

<p>“‘Once fairly established in the household of
the Marquise de Boulainvilliers, the fortune of the
children of the Count de Saint Remy changed
from the lowest depths of misery to a state of ease
and affluence, of which they could not even have
dreamed. It appears, however, that the marquise,
for some reason or other, very soon abandoned her
darling project of rearing her little protegées <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à la
Jean Jacques</i>; for, after suffering them to run<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340">340</a></span>
wild about her park at Passy, well-dressed but
barefoot, for some time, she procured the boy’s
admission into the Ecole de Marine, despatched
the little Marguerite to the care of a nurse in Burgundy,
but retained among her dependents the
lively Jeanne, always with the promise that she
would prosecute her cause at court with the utmost
vigour and perseverance, and declaring that she
had no doubt of the ultimate success of her undertaking,
for that Madame Elizabeth, with all the
ardour and warmth of benevolence which characterizes
youth, had promised to second her application
to the king. It was in the midst of this good
will, and Madame de la Motte declared without
any fault on her part, that, by a singular caprice,
for which she could not account, and which, by the
bye, she slurred over in rather an embarrassed tone,
her protectress suddenly changed her manner
towards her, and one day, having declared to her
that it was considered in the society in which she
moved, both imprudent and derogatory to retain in
her family a person in the position of Mademoiselle
de Saint Remy, announced to her that she had
taken the necessary measures to place her with
Madame Leclercq, the most famous <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">couturière</i> of
the day in Paris!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341">341</a></span>
“‘The astonishment and indignation of poor
Jeanne, on hearing this sentence, can well be
imagined, but there was no appeal. What right
had she to complain, who had been taken from the
streets but a short time before by the kindness of
the marquise? Besides, there was some consolation
still amid her trouble, for Madame de Boulainvilliers
promised not to neglect her suit at court,
and I really believe did continue to prosecute it
with undiminished zeal. It appears that it was
Monsieur le Marquis who had insisted upon the
dismissal of Jeanne—for what offence remains a
mystery—but there must have been a grievous
cause of displeasure, I judge, by the hatred which
existed between the pair, and which was not satisfied
on the part of the marquis, even by the
imprisonment and disgrace of his victim.<a id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">B</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_B" href="#FNanchor_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> I have heard the circumstance of this dire offending
variously discussed, but I believe the true version of the tale
to run thus:—Poor Jeanne, who had been afflicted by nature
with an incurable curiosity, had discovered, in one of her barefooted
rambles in the park at Passy, the entrance to the secret
still which M. le Marquis de Boulainvilliers, in common with
many French noblemen of the time, worked illicitly, in defiance
of law or justice, and from which many of them derived
the principal source of the colossal fortunes which they possessed.
With primitive simplicity, Jeanne kept her discovery
a profound secret, but used to spend her time suspended by a
branch above the hole in the mound of earth, which concealed,
by a clump of brambles and wild barberries, the entrance to
the passage which served for the descent to the unlawful
hiding-place. Here she would remain for whole hours together,
gazing down, and watching with interest and amusement
the whole process of the conversion of good grain into liquor,
never once betraying herself by the slightest exclamation or
gesture to the poor fools who worked on below, little supposing
they were thus overlooked and noted.
</p>
<p>The day of reckoning arrived at last; the château—the
park—the gardens of Passy, were one morning filled with the
emissaries of the police; every closet and cellar underwent a
thorough scrutiny; the servants were strictly examined; but
M. de Boulainvilliers laughed to scorn every attempt at detection;
for he alone of all the household was in the secret of
the illicit still. Disappointed and confused, the officers were
retiring to report upon the fruitlessness of their errand, when
Jeanne came bursting into the apartment, exclaiming, ‘I know
where it is—I know it—this way, gentlemen—this way! To
think of all this trouble, when I knew it so well! How fortunate
I should have just been told what it was you were seeking!
Come along, <em>I</em> will show you the still. How strange that
Monsieur le Marquis should not have known that it was in
the park! but I will show him the nearest way. Oh, come
along quick! it is in full glory at this very moment—the fire
blazing—the sparks flying splendidly; <em>two</em> men were at the
bellows when I left!’
</p>
<p>The consternation, the rage, the terror which these words
produced, cannot be described. M. le Marquis was hurried
off to prison, amid the laughter of the officers and the sobs and
tears of the Marquise; while poor Jeanne received, with
astonishment, the furious kicks and cuffs of the marquis, instead
of the thanks and praises to which she deemed herself
entitled. From this hour the marquis, who had ever hated
the child, vowed most bitter vengeance against her, and, on
his leaving prison, commenced his system of persecution,
which ceased not until he had contributed to bring down his
victim to the lowest depths of desolation and infamy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342">342</a></span></p></div>

<p>“‘Jeanne remained with the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">couturière</i> for two
long mortal years, during which the marquise
wearied every minister, every man in place, with
prayers and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">placets</i> on behalf of her <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">protégée</i>;
and, at length, one fine day, she sent for her to
meet her brother, whom she had not seen since
his departure for Brest, and when she arrived, the
lacquey in waiting introduced them both into the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i>, filled with the highest company, as Monsieur<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343">343</a></span>
le Baron de Valois, and Mademoiselle de
Valois!</p>

<p>“‘Madame de Boulainvilliers had prepared the
scene—she expected tears of gratitude and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">élans</i>
of sentiment—but she was disappointed: the boy
drew back, abashed at the novelty of his situation,
and Jeanne uttered not a single word, but fainted!
From this hour did a change take place in her
character; her real nature, Stirring and ambitious,
now began to show itself without disguise; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344">344</a></span>
years of rags and starvation were forgotten, as likewise
the humiliation of her days of toil and labour
with the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">couturière</i>. She had but one drawback—the
insufficiency of the pension allotted by the
government, until the estates in Dauphiné and the
châteaux in Brittany, and the forests in Maine,
belonging to the title, and upon which the crown
had seized in former reigns, were restored to her
family,—when she might move with the splendour
becoming her rank, and take her place among the
princesses of the blood royal, as beseemed her
name and descent. The pension was of eight hundred
livres only per annum—a pittance barely
sufficient to enable her to clothe herself with decency;
but again did Madame de Boulainvilliers, the
tried friend, come to her assistance, and, proud of
her work, of having by her exertions caused the
title to be recognised, now offered to pay her
board in some convent, which she had refused to
do so long as she was only poor Jeanne de Saint
Remy.</p>

<p>“‘She retired then to a convent at Bar-sur-Aube,
her native place, where she captivated the
affections of the Count de la Motte, a young man
of excellent family but small fortune, and they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345">345</a></span>
were soon afterwards married; and, with this auspicious
event, <em>her</em> romance, like many others, might
have been supposed to be concluded. But, alas,
for her! there was yet a second volume. When I
saw her, as I have described to you, at the Hôtel
Cardinal, she had come to Paris to prosecute her
suit with the ministers for the restoration of her
estates. She was supported by the powerful interest
of the Rohans. She was of a bold, enterprising,
ambitious nature, fearless and intriguing,
with friends at court devoted to her cause; and
yet it will to this day excite a certain suspicion in
my mind whenever I think of all the circumstances
which followed—she never could gain access to
the queen!</p>

<p>“‘It is said that Marie Antoinette had, in
reality, the greatest desire to converse with her,
but was prevented from receiving her by the express
command of his majesty, who had conceived
the most invincible dread of her presence near the
throne, from having been told of her extraordinary
powers of fascination. He had a great horror of
this species of character about the queen; and
Madame de la Motte had already acquired (it
seemed with great injustice <em>then</em>) the reputation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346">346</a></span>
of a troublesome, ambitious <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">intrigante</i>. Like all
persons of indolent temperament, Louis Seize ever
felt a mortal dread of stirring, active people. Infirm
of purpose himself, he disliked those who
were resolute and steady in the accomplishment of
their designs; therefore his aversion to Madame
de la Motte would not have been remarkable, had
it not been for the very perseverance which it gave
him occasion to exercise—perhaps the only instance
of tenacity he ever displayed—for he resisted
on this occasion the prayers and entreaties
of the queen, and the supplications of Madame
Elizabeth. Nothing could soften him, and, when
pressed to give a reason for this steadiness of
hatred, he could not tell—<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">c’etait plus fort que
lui</i>!</p>

<p>“‘Of course, the enemies of royalty and the partisans
of Madame de la Motte did not fail, in after
times, to lay this preconceived antipathy on the
part of the king to the score of avarice, and to the
dread he most naturally felt at the prospect of
being compelled to resign the magnificent estates
and royal privileges of the Valois to the legal
claimants. If the suspicion had been just, he certainly
would not have admitted their claim to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347">347</a></span>
title at all. He might have resorted to delay, or
have avoided the recognition altogether. As it
was, however, the affair certainly displayed want of
tact, and great mismanagement, in the allotment of
the pension. Either the claim set forth by the
Saint Remys was an imposture, and should have
been treated with contempt, or it was just, and,
when once recognised as such, should have been
met with the liberality and consideration which it
deserved. This first error was most bitterly expiated,
and Louis Seize must often have mourned
most grievously over the want of consistency and
false economy of his ministers.</p>

<p>“‘I cannot help thinking that a more liberal
allowance, by rendering unnecessary all the struggles
for existence which Madame de la Motte was
compelled to make, might have deadened her ambition,
and she might have spent her days, satisfied
to display her love of intrigue, and exhibit her
powers of fascination, on the restricted theatre of
Bar-sur-Aube, her husband’s birthplace and her
own, to which she was much attached, and which
she herself declared she never would have left, had
not her presence been considered necessary in
Paris, so long as there was hope that the estates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348">348</a></span>
might be restored to her family. Every one who
knows the sequel of her history must remember
that (supposing her to be guilty) it was the affection
she bore to her native place, which was the ultimate
cause of her ruin; for, had she followed the
advice of friends, and fled to England immediately,
she might have been saved. But no—how <em>could</em>
she leave the country without taking one last farewell
of her beloved Bar-sur-Aube?—one of the
ugliest places, by the bye, throughout the whole of
France.</p>

<p>“‘I have told you the story which I heard from
the lips of Madame de la Motte herself, at the
Cardinal de Rohan’s table, and I again say that I
believe most of the particulars to be strictly true,
although they differ in some points from the tale
she afterwards told in her memoirs. But therein
she might have been influenced by many motives
in the recital, whereas with us she was evidently
governed but by one—that of exciting as much interest
as possible in the breast of the Princesse de
Guéménée; for, of course, the cardinal had already
heard the story many times before, and I was
reckoned as nothing. In itself the history is undoubtedly
a most touching one; but when told as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349">349</a></span>
I then heard it, by the heroine herself, with the
most expressive action, the most varied intonation,
and <em>real</em> tears, the effect was irresistible, and I
then understood, without further explanation, the
fascination in which she held the cardinal, and
which had excited my wonder and disgust but so
short a time before. Even the princess herself,
with all her preconceived aversion, was subdued at
length, and, before she took her leave, graciously
invited the countess to meet at supper on the following
evening a party of friends, among whom
were some whose acquaintance might facilitate the
prosecution of her suit. Among others I perfectly
remember that she named M. de Crosne, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">lieutenant
de police</i>. Little did the poor countess
dream, when her eyes flashed such proud triumph
even on <em>me</em>, that the time would come when she
would be favoured with many and many an unsought
interview with M. de Crosne, in the Bastile,
and that from his lips would she have to listen to
the repetition of the sentence which condemned
her to the most ignominious fate that could in our
country befal a woman.</p>

<p>“‘I know not by what chance, on my taking
leave of the cardinal for the night, his Eminence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350">350</a></span>
happened to mention the name of my mother; but
suddenly the whole demeanour of Madame de la
Motte was changed towards me, upon learning that
I was the son of the Countess de Talleyrand, dame
du palais to the queen, and she began immediately
to <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">agacer</i> me with her attentions, with as much
determination as she had before avoided even a
glance in my direction. She turned, all smiles and
affability, to inquire if I had a carriage in waiting
to convey me to my residence, and, on my replying
in the negative, insisted on my taking the
vacant seat in her own, to which I most willingly
assented. It was during the short drive from the
Hôtel Cardinal to the Place Dauphine, where she
resided, that I was enabled to judge more fully
of her extraordinary vivacity and tact, and above
all, of her wonderful aptitude for business; for,
before we parted, she had extorted from me a promise
to induce my mother to present her statement
to the queen, which promise I religiously kept,
although I obtained nought but a flat refusal for
my pains, followed by many a bitter reproach for
meddling with the affairs ‘of this <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">aventurière</i>.’
I his was the first and last time I ever beheld the
countess; and, when she became a public character<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351">351</a></span>
through her participation in the affair of the
necklace, I had reason to rejoice that such was the
case, for had she but imagined that I was fit to
serve her purpose, I feel that it is not unlikely
I might have lost the right of regarding with scorn
the infatuation of the cardinal prince. So great
was the power of will possessed by this woman,
that there must have been inordinate self-conceit
in the man who would have dared to pretend to
defy it.’”</p>

<p>“What was the opinion of M. de Talleyrand
concerning the affair of the necklace? Did he
believe Madame de la Motte really guilty of the
theft?”</p>

<p>“‘Much less than is supposed by the public,
and certainly infinitely less so than her condemnation
purported. I once ventured to ask him if he
knew any of the particulars connected with this
extraordinary business, and his reply, although
guarded, gave me a suspicion that, although he did
not believe her innocent, he felt convinced that
her guilt was shared by some whose birth and
influence near the throne shielded them from exposure.</p>

<p>“‘There is a degree of mystery throughout the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352">352</a></span>
whole transaction,’ replied he, in answer to my inquiries,
‘which is, perhaps, destined never to be
cleared up. Had Madame de la Motte possessed
the cunning of the arch-fiend himself, she <em>could</em>
not have been guilty of one-tenth part of the baseness
which was imputed to her in the act of accusation;
there were impediments both social and
commercial to many of the manœuvres, which were
<em>proved</em> against her on her trial. You can form no
conception of the excitement produced by this
event. The whole kingdom was divided for her
sake into two sects, the unbelieving and the credulous;
those who believed her guilty, and those
who <em>knew</em> her to be innocent. For myself, I have
heard so much on both sides, that my opinion is
scarcely stable even now. It is a singular fact
that all the persons who visited her were fully convinced
of her innocence, and fought like lions in
her defence.</p>

<p>“‘The Abbé de Kel, the almoner of the Bastile,
and confessor of Madame de la Motte, told me
himself, that his firm opinion in the case was this:
‘That, had she not been unfortunate enough to
have already obtained the recognition of her title,
she would not have been condemned.’ Monsieur<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353">353</a></span>
de Breteuil, the great enemy of the cardinal, and
favourite of the queen, was most active in procuring
materials to inculpate this unfortunate woman,
and this circumstance having got abroad, greatly
contributed to excite suspicion against Marie Antoinette.
But the circumstance which in reality
formed the basis of her ruin, was the denial of the
cardinal that he had ever furnished her with money.
<em>This must have been false</em>, for, long before her
arrest, she was living in splendour, had an hôtel in
the Place Dauphine, with servants and equipages,
was richly attired, and covered with jewels, and all
this, forsooth, upon her husband’s limited income,
and her own pittance of eight hundred livres! I
remember being told that the furniture of her hôtel
equalled in richness that of the palace at Trianon.
Mention was made of polished steel mirrors, set in
gold, and of a famous bed, the hangings of which
were worked in seed pearl, which was bought for
an enormous sum by Madame du Barry, the late
king’s mistress.</p>

<p>“‘Another mystery, which completely baffles
all speculation, is the total disappearance of the
necklace itself, the object of all this turmoil. It
was a jewel so well known among the trade in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354">354</a></span>
Paris that every single stone would have been
recognised. There was scarcely a person of any
note in the capital who had not seen it, as it had
lain at Boehmer’s, the jeweller’s, for more than a
year, open to the inspection of any one who chose
to ask for the sight of it. I recollect having seen
it not a long while before it created so much disturbance.
Boehmer had been employed to furnish
the wedding jewels for one of my relations, and the
morning that he came to deliver them, he brought
the necklace for us to view, as a curiosity. Neither
in the workmanship nor the size of the stones did
it give any notion of the immense value which was
set upon it. I believe, however, that this consisted
in the stones being all brilliants of the first
water, and, as a collection, the most perfect and
free from blemish (so Boehmer told my aunt) in
the whole world.</p>

<p>“‘There is one more story connected with the
jewel, which greatly complicates the mystery of
the whole transaction, and which is known but to
few persons. During the time that I held the
Portefeuille of Foreign Affairs, I received a letter
from our ambassador at one of the northern courts,
wherein he announced to me, with great excitement,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355">355</a></span>
the arrival at his court of the Count de
M——y and his wife. They had been presented
by himself to the sovereign; for, although they
might, strictly speaking, have been considered
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">emigrés</i>, not having returned to France during the
reign of Napoleon, yet, as the count was not at
that time the head of his family, and had never
meddled in politics, he had a right to claim the
protection of the ambassador of his country. The
lady had chosen for her <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">début</i> at court the occasion
of a royal birthday, and she had made her
appearance laden with all her jewels, and, “upon
her neck,” wrote the baron, “she wore a necklace of
the exact pattern of that, concerning which all
Europe had been roused before the revolution—that
is to say, the only difference being, that the
three scroll ornaments which are so remarkable,
and to which I could swear as being the same, are
held by a chain of small rose diamonds instead of
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rivière</i>, by which they were joined before.”</p>

<p>“‘The letter gave us all great diversion at
home, from the excitement in which it was written;
but the emperor, to whom I of course communicated
the fact, took it more gravely, and begged
me to ask for a drawing of the necklace, which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356">356</a></span>
ambassador found means to obtain, and which was
found to correspond with that preserved among the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pièces du procès</i> in the Archives; moreover, on its
being submitted to young Boehmer, he declared
his full and entire conviction that the jewel was
the same, from the remarkable circumstance of a
mistake having occurred in the execution of the
middle ornament, one side of the scroll containing
two small diamonds more than the other, and
which he remembered had much distressed his
father, but which could never have been discovered
save by a member of the trade. It was then remembered,
and by the emperor himself first of all,
that the lady’s mother had been attached to the
person of Marie Antoinette, and that she had
retired from court and gone to reside abroad soon
after the trial of Madame de la Motte!</p>

<p>“‘So you see there is another link in the chain
of evidence which historians, when writing any
future history of the Diamond Necklace, would do
well to examine.</p>

<p>“‘Louis Dixhuit was evidently aware of the history,
for I remember once being struck with a
conversation reported to me by the Marquis de
F——. The young Count de B——, one of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357">357</a></span>
most notorious <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bêtes</i> at court, said one day in the
presence of the king, “I wonder why the M——y
family do not come back to claim their hereditary
charges at court? What pleasure can they find in
the horrid country they have chosen?—<em>I</em> could
not live there for a single hour.”</p>

<p>“‘Perhaps you could not,’ retorted Louis Dixhuit,
in his penny-trumpet voice, and with his
childish titter, ‘but the Count de M——y <em>can</em>,—for
it is a woody country, and unlike France, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">on y
brûle la bûche et jamais</i> <span class="smcap">La Motte</span>.’</p>

<p>“‘The Marquis de F—— had applied to me to
know the meaning of the pun. The ambassador’s
letter immediately flashed on my memory, but I
did not choose to have the affair discussed with my
name, so held my peace.’</p>

<p>“This is all the information I could ever obtain
from the prince,” added C., in conclusion, “concerning
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fameux collier</i>; but this last anecdote
so excited my curiosity, that I immediately set to
work and procured every pamphlet of note which
had been written on the subject, and, by the help
of this new light, was enabled to penetrate much of
the darkness by which the affair is enveloped to
the generality of the world. If you take any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358">358</a></span>
interest in the matter, it is really worth your while
to do the same. What is still further worthy of
remark is the fact that the family of the lady in
question did not return to France even after the
Restoration, and have continued to dwell abroad
ever since. The name is one of the highest in
France, and it excites astonishment to find it enrolled
in the service of a foreign country.”</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
